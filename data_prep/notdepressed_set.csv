He's breaking the cycle of poverty. He is more likely to have children that go to college. For now he wants to do mechanical engineering, and he's already into robotics and 3D printing. He's going to kill it.

Join me in celebrating tonight. Raise a glass to the rare, *rare* foster kid that makes it out OK. He's got 4 younger siblings that get to watch him set the pace. He's going to be their hero.

\*Edit\* Didn't mean for this to be self\-congratulatory if it comes across that way. My wife and I have been in this boy's life for only about 6 months. 100&#37; of the credit goes to him and him alone, I'm just happy to be here to support him.

\*Edit 2\* Reddit Gold? 2,000 up doots and climbing? I was always worried that my top post would be some silly cat video. Glad it was something nice about my kid instead. Yay internet, you rock.

\*Edit 3\* I've read every single reply up to this point, and tried to comment when I thought I could provide value. Thank you all so very much for the kind words. Both of my teens will be reading this post and your advice, congratulations, and other kind words will hit their mark.

3,0,"My gf and I were both living off our savings while looking for a rental, which opened us up to living in areas we might not have otherwise considered. We found a massive, beautiful, recently remodeled townhouse well within our budget and half a mile from the office I had just gotten hired at. 

We had both mostly lived in middle-class suburbs before. The week we moved in, there was a murder at the gas station located at the entrance of our neighborhood. This area was always ""the bad part of town"" in my mind and in the minds of my peers. When people asked where we lived, we named the interstate exit and never our street. 

The first week I lived there, I was considering putting bars on the lower level windows. I nearly jumped out of my skin one night when I heard footsteps in the woods behind the house. I was almost ready to run inside to grab a knife when a fat, trash eating possum waddled by. ""Phew! I thought you might be a crackhead,"" I'll never admit to thinking. 

After two years, I've come to realize that I don't live in a bad neighborhood. It's just a not-mostly-white and low-income neighborhood. I have neighbors of every color and we all wave at each other, talk, laugh, and get along. 

If I forget to take my trash out on trash day, my next door neighbor often does it for me. That shit never happened in the suburbs. There's a stray cat that has gained about 5 kitty pounds recently because me and both the houses next to me have been feeding the little shit. That's pretty cool and neighborly. 

Last Friday my gf and I were out back at 3am. We heard a rustling in the woods. Soon after a tall, shadowy figure of a black man appeared. No panic was felt. I have since learned that it could be a possum or it could be a homeless person. I've had many nights where a homeless person comes walking through the woods and we get to talking and hanging out. Sometimes I share my booze with them, sometimes I share some food, and on a couple occasions I give them a blanket and let them sleep on my lawn chair. So when a shadowy figure of a black man appeared at 3am, I didn't panic. Instead I called out, ""hey, Too Tall? That you?!"" It was him. 

So, the prejudice I have overcome isn't color based like you might have assumed. It was class based. I no longer immediately equate low income with dangerous and ignorant. 

This might be a little heavy for this sub, but I can't think of a better place to talk about this without it turning into a shit show. So, please, share your thoughts. I just renewed my lease another two years. "
4,0,"Hello, my name is Jack. I'm sorry I haven't updated in 2 months. I am a 50 year old man who was never able to conceive with my wife. We really wanted to adopt but were unable to due to financial issues until recently. 



As you may know [we adopted a 15 year old boy named Jonathan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/74x3rq/i_adopted_a_teenage_boy/) He has been dealing with depression, anxiety, anger issues, PTSD, and an eating disorder. 


So what's changed since two months ago when we had recently adopted him? 


For starters, Jonathan was kicked out of yet another school quickly for fighting (the school he had been in before we adopted him but only for like a couple months) so we decided to put Jonathan in a special school for troubled youth. 


Although it's a very slow process and he still skips class and gets in fights this school is definitely doing some good. They focus on how to fit into the world, mental health, anger management, all stuff relevant to Jonathan's life.


Jonathan still smokes. I found text messages on his phone between him and another boy about a drug transaction. The drug in question was oxycodone. I asked him (in a pub casually so that he felt relaxed and not pressured) why he wanted this drug; opiates, while providing pain relief, can be very addictive and dangerous.


 He basically told me that his pain and trauma are bigger than anything pot and cigarettes could help with. I told him its a very bad idea to buy opiates off the street and if he is looking for help all he needs to do is ask and we will try to help best we can. So, I scheduled an appointment with the doctor. He agreed not to go through with the transaction so I told him I was proud of him and I swear he smiled a little bit.


As you may of remembered, Jonathan since meeting him has been extremely aggressive. I was prepared to take this on since the moment I met him as I am much taller and bigger than him. I was, however, a bit afraid for my wife. Well, Jonathan has thrown things at me and attempted to hit me and such many, many times since I met him but he has never tried to hurt my wife at all and for that I see he is a good boy and he can live a normal, happy life eventually if he can get passed all the trauma in his life.


Well I signed him up for boxing early on and gave him a punching bag and that helped at the beginning, although he was still very aggressive. Lot's of these issues that come with adopted children take nothing but time and care and support to resolve and two months later Jonathan, while still aggressive, is getting better every day. 



In the two months since I originally posted, he has stopped freaking out every day. He still gets mad everyday but not freak out-throw things-scream mad, just mad. The freakouts i'd say come about once a week now which is a huge improvement.



We still go to the pub once a week which he has always really enjoyed. I think one of the things with Jonathan is he likes to be treated as an equal. 


Jonathan speaks more than he used to. This is a great achievement because in my orignal post he just got angry or was silent but in these past two months he has started to speak more. Sometimes just random things like 'have you read this article in the newspaper'. 


It's a slow process but it's really awesome seeing Jonathan progress further and further as time goes on. I believe he can get through this all and move towards a bright future.



Edit: I forgot to mention the eating. Yeah, it is still as much of a challenge to get Jonathan to eat as it was 2 months ago when I made the original post unfortunately. "
5,0,"Yes, her rendition of the National Anthem was... not great. But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they're being really harsh.


There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)


That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn't committed suicide was because of her family and kids.


So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she's still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.

Just because someone is famous, or just because you've never met them, doesn't make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It's still bullying.

I guess I'm just venting because people *reeaally* like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I'm sick of it. That is all.


 **Edit:** Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I'd love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:

- Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I'm happy this started a good discussion.

- I understand that it's Fergie's job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at 'em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don't want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.

- Obligatory ""Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!""

Okay, that's all I've got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.


**Edit 2:** Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, ""Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn't really matter.""

Well, here's my reply I made to one of those commenters:

>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. 

>However, there's a reason the phrase ""money can't buy happiness"" exists.

>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.

>Still, while the ""landscape"" is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.

>That's what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.

>All I'm saying is, let's not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.

6,0,"I've known this girl for a couple years now and we've always been really close. We met in residence in our first year of university and now in our third I live right across the street from her, so we see each other everyday. I've never been closer/more open with anyone else, but I never imagined her in a romantic context (even though everyone who knows us has told me we should date). Well, I did, but wouldn't admit it to myself.

Anyway, she recently broke up with her long-term boyfriend and since then we've been spending even more time together. I sorta took notice but didn't do or say anything different because I didn't imagine she thought of me that way and also she just got out of a break-up, so obviously she just wants company. 

But last night coming home from bar trivia she comes over as she normally does to have another drink and listen to music. We're both half-falling asleep and half-cuddling when she puts on this song that I absolutely love. Something just clicked in my head then and I lean in to kiss her.

Turns out we've both been crushing on each other for years. We stayed up all night laughing at ourselves in between kisses. It's fantastic feeling, being with a girl you already know you love. I've been smiling all day and I just had to tell someone. 

Thanks for hearing me out, reddit. Sending good vibes your way. 


**Edit** Thank you all for the well wishes and support. I'm glad that you can enjoy this as much as I am (well, probably not as much as me, but in the neighborhood). You guys are the best.

9,0,"Last week I was sharing a hostel room with only one other person. He turned off the light to go to sleep, climbed into bed, and then started asking me questions about my life. We talked about our lives, our countries, his divorce, my future, politics, being a woman vs a man traveling, etc. None of it ever crossed the line or made me feel uncomfortable. 

We talked for hours, and I never even saw his face, since there was furniture between us and the lights were off. I think that helped us both be completely honest in our answers and emotions. It was just one of those experiences that will stick with me for a long time. "
10,0,"This is a bit embarrassing, but last winter in my city it was really, really cold. I was young and paying rent and not making a lot, but I'd just been given my tips for the week so I was downtown trying to get Christmas presents. I saw a homeless teenager lying on the sidewalk, and feeling the tips heavy in my pocket I pulled out a $20 bill and handed it to him. He stared at me and said ""really?"" And I laughed and told him to buy a blanket and kept walking. 
When I left I realized how dumb I was, because I knew it was likely he'd buy drugs or alcohol. However a small part of me thought there was a chance that he'd put it to good use. 
Anyways, the next week I saw the same guy with a brand new fluffy blanket over him. 
I didn't tell my family this or anyone else really because I feel so odd about handing someone $20 like that, especially since they know I'm tight on money myself! But I thought I'd share it here, maybe it'll brighten someone's day :)

Edit: thank you for the gold!! Now I need to figure out what to do with it :)

I'm not really understanding the hate. Even if I was a ""karma whore"", which I'm not, isn't this at least a break from all the sexual assault news and everything else that's happening? It was something that happened that I haven't told anyone, so I thought I'd post it here! :)

Also apparently I've been featured on r/humblebrag or whatever it's called. If it came across this way, I'm sorry. Like I said, I just wanted to share something positive! "
11,0,"I'm still puzzled, I don't know why she did that. "
12,0,"OK, I must warn you that this is a long and strange story. Sit down, bust out the popcorn, and prepare to be underwhelmed. 

A year or so ago, I was sitting around watching youtube. I didn't have adblock at the time, so I was watching an ad for the Seat Toca (a car). There was a song in the background of this ad, and I *loved it*. The ad was only about 30 seconds long, but the song was bloody amazing. I was immediately determined to find this song. 

I started watching the ad on repeat, trying to figure out the lyrics so I could google the song and find it (my usual strategy). But nothing turned up. 

People in the comments section were discussing the song; several other people were trying to find it. Someone said it sounded like a guy called Mike something (I can't remember the full name of the artist). So I searched for Mike something, and went through a lot of his discography. But still - no luck. I tried searching his name + the lyrics, but... nothing. 

I tried using shazam. For those who aren't familiar, this is an app that uses the microphone on your phone to identify songs. The idea is that you play the song, turn on the app, and the app will tell you the name and artist of the song. But shazam was bloody hopeless, and couldn't identify the song. I downloaded the app, just for this one song, and deleted it when it failed me. 

At this point, I must admit that I was watching the 30-second ad once or twice a day, just so I could listen to the song, no matter how briefly. 

My next step was to *email the Seat marketing department*. I'm deadly serious, I actually did this. I sent a polite email, asking what the song was called. A few days later, I got a reply. The Seat employee told me that the song was a special commission for this particular ad, and wasn't available for general release. Essentially, it's not a real song, and there's no way to find it. 

I was heartbroken, but also felt a certain sense of closure. I popped back into the youtube comment section, and let everyone know about my findings. I had been keeping my IRL friends updated throughout this entire saga. They found it hilarious, and mocked me for the effort I was expending in order to find this song. I'm the kind of guy who can be very determined - if I want something, I'll put a lot of effort into getting it. This was just another weird project of mine, which unfortunately didn't work out. 

But so it goes. I moved on. I almost forgot about the song.

Fast forward to today, about one year after I originally heard the song. I get a random PM on Reddit. It's from a user I've never spoken to; a user who frequents subreddits that I'm not subscribed to. I have no idea who this person is. 

The PM simply said: 

>Song - Turn the lights down Artist - BSO

This song is on spotify, but not youtube or anywhere else. I made a spotify account, just to hear this song - if a random stranger PMs you a song, you have a duty to listen to it, right?

Well, I think you can all guess where this is going. Yes. Yes. IT'S THE BLOODY SONG! IT'S THE ACTUAL, LEGIT, FULL VERSION OF THE SONG!

I have no idea who that redditor is. I have no idea how they found me, and I have no idea how they knew about that song. I'm fairly sure I never mentioned it on Reddit. I send them a slightly crazed reply; a mix of utter gratitude and utter confusion. My reply read as follows:

>Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. I'm actually freaking out.

>Who are you? How did you know? WHAT IS GOING ON?

>Thank you so much. But also, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

Their response was 

> Shh bby is ok

I shit you not. Never before have I felt such love for a total stranger. 

So, yeah. Wow. This is a pretty huge deal for me. 

For context, [here's the ad that started it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxkWhTrSPVI). The song is called ""turn the lights down"", by an artist called BSO. The full song isn't actually as great as I had hoped, *but that's not the point!*

Edit - I've just realised that this whole post might be construed as a pathetic attempt at viral marketing for Seat. So I want to state that Seat are a terrible company, their cars are awful, and they are capitalist pigdogs that do not deserve your money. 

Edit2 - [here](http://imgur.com/RX7aea0) is a screenshot of the PM.

Edit3 - last one, I promise. [here](https://i.imgur.com/GAJvnao.png) is the email from Seat. [Here](http://imgur.com/TXs2aNE) is the full unredacted PM conversation (I didn't want to post this until I knew /u/TheVikingHoward was comfortable with it). We're starting to get an idea of what might have happened, but I'm not gonna tell you here because it ruins the story. This is not a marketing campaign, I am not a member of BSO, and I did not fake the whole thing using alt accounts. Shh. "
13,0,"I am a 50 year old man. My wife and I were never able to conceive. I wanted to help out a kid in foster care and give them a warm, loving home they otherwise wouldn't be able to get. Unfortunately, adoption takes time and money and we were not able to for some time as our financial state was poor until the last 5 years. 


When we started the adoption process we decided to adopt a teenager instead as they are usually neglected because adults seem to generally want babies/little kids. 


The boy we adopted's name is Jonathan. He is 15. He had been through some tough shit; abuse, neglect, being bounced from foster to home and back again. He was suffering with depression, anger issues, PTSD, and an eating disorder. 


I'll skip the boring process and tell you about what life has been like since we brought him home.


It has not been an easy task. Jonathan smokes alot (which we didn't know). When school started, we got notified that Jonathan was skipping class. We confronted him about it and he just seems to ignore us or tell us its his life so he doesn't care. At first when we adopted him he was cautious because he didn't know how we'd react to things - he thought he might get beat. Now that he knows that won't happen he's gotten more comfortable which is good but he has also gotten more teenage-ish and snipey. 


Jonathan gets into fights. He was sent home the other day for getting into scrap with another student. When we confronted him about it, he told us we weren't his parents and we should stop acting like it. We sent him to his room and basically grounded him. He got angry in his room and started punching the wall. I tried to be as calm as I could and asked him why he was angry. He screamed at me to f-off and tried to throw something at me but I dodged it. I continued to be calm. I told him if he apologized for yelling at me and attempting to hit me with something we could go to the pub and talk through this. After a minute he apologized and off to the pub we went.



He had calmed down a bit by the time we got there and served so I was ready to talk to him. He thought it was pretty cool that I didn't get angry or retaliate. I told him things are different in this house. I told him violence doesn't accomplish anything. After a drink we began to talk. I tried to talk to him about the matter at hand; why he was angry. I got a bit out of him. I won't give out all the details for privacy sake but I did get some useful information from his perspective that helps me understand a bit of what he is going through.


Since then, it's gotten a bit better. Once a week we got to the pub and he tells me some things. We are trying to provide as much support and love and care as we can. The other day he got mad and said we weren't his parents. I said ""but we are the ones who care for you"". He is a bit secretive which is why the pub thing works well. We are working on trying to get him to control his anger issues; we signed him up for boxing lessons to take it out on a punch bag instead of property. He is enjoying boxing. Getting him to eat is a challenge but we are working on that, too. 



I hope in the next years he can get better towards a bright future. I know this isn't really promoting conversation but I just wanna say if you can afford to adopt please do it. It can really help change  a persons life.

So I googled their number (I know the rapper Logic made a song about it but never remembered the number) and I made the call. I normally have trouble really opening up to anyone. I tend to not want people knowing how I feel. I got connected with a guy who sounded like he was in his later 30’s and really was not who I was expecting either. I had a light conversation with him at first just because I was lonely and it was nice to hear someone’s voice. I decided to tell him that this will be my last night. And what conversation followed next was something that I really didn’t anticipate for. After the call ended, I broke down and really couldn’t believe that I was so close to not waking up in the morning. Two of my friends have committed suicide this year and if only they had called what I called, I still would have those two friends. 



I came here to tell you guys about it because I have no one else to tell it to. Honestly, you can ask me anything and I’ll probably answer it. I’m open to any questions or discussion. If you have anything more personal, you can dm too 



The number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-TALK (8255). If you’re going through anything, and you really think there is nothing left, just call them. I wouldn’t be here right now otherwise. 

Wow, all of this support is amazing, absolutely amazing 

I just want to add that the Suicide Prevention Lifeline is not just for people who are thinking of ending their lives way before they should be. The Lifeline can offer advice to people helping others as well. It’s meant for everyone affected by mental health through family, friends, or strangers alike! 

This is crazy amazing. Thank you to everyone for the support. The amount of unique stories I am receiving, I’m gonna be replying for days! But i will be replying to everyone! Thank you so much for everything. You’re making this the greatest day of my life <3  

I want to thank everyone for coming to me with their stories! Everyone is so unique and everything that everyone is saying stands for love and friendship! You guys really make life worth living and I’m scared knowing that i couldn’t have experienced this day...

I love you all so much getting to reply to all of your comments. I didn’t think it was possible that this many loving and caring people had so many unique stories about their lives. You need to know that no matter what, if you’re going through something, have gone through something, or know someone who is going through something. You might not know how many days someone has left in their minds. But you can always change that last day and give someone new life. 

Suicide awareness should be so much more important that just a week or the year for people to recognize it. Through that Lifeline are the friends you never knew you had until you took that step. I always worried it would just be some robotic speaking person who would not know how i feel. But it’s not... they’re someone who actually does care. If you don’t believe me, try it yourself. Because wether you know someone, or it’s yourself... we have been through some low times and they are unique... no situation is the same

I've no idea if he suffered a heart attack or what but he was unresponsive, not breathing and no pulse when I got to him. He had recently been released from hospital for a stent. When I say I lost and got him back, he started breathing deeply on his own three times, each time I put him in recovery, he'd stop breathing before I could find a pulse, I'd start CPR again. He was completely unresponsive when the ambos came, my father in law told me he was sitting up in the ambulance (I was in the kitchen freaking out!). I posted here wanting to offload and share my big, somewhat scary experience with a few kind strangers. The love and positivity I've received has been amazing. Stay brilliant all you beautiful bastards of Reddit. Finally, awesome job mods for keeping the trolls and haters at bay. Over and out."

28,0,"I am not a huge movie person, especially not a comic book movie person. I had no idea this is what the movie was about. Never saw a promotional ad, picture, commercial. I figured it was one of those Oscar-bait historical dramas. Then I just saw a picture of the main characters in costume.....not the outfits I was expecting! "
29,0,"When I was going through a severe clinically depressive time in my 20s, I was very inactive. Mostly, I would lock myself in my apt and avoid everything.

When I first watched this movie, it made me laugh for the first time I quite a while. I remember feeling something other than despair. 

Thus began my path to betterment. I would watch it multiple times a day. It would be in the background ayong as I prepared myself  for the day, while I cooked, while I studied, and everything inbetween.

It wasn't only the humor. It was also the message. There is no secret ingredient to happiness. I internalized this and it really seemed to help. 

Fast forward multiple years, and this movie still hits me in the feels. It makes me emotional when I watch it. 

I LOVE Kung Fu Panda!"
30,0,"My friend recently started dating this postgrad student from Kazakhstan. When I first met her, we had the inevitable 'I don't know much about Kazakhstan aside from Borat' conversation, and I went away feeling kind of ignorant.

Today we all met up for drinks, and I thought it would be cute to learn how to say 'how are you?' in Kazakh and greet her with it. I was expecting her to laugh and say 'nice effort' and then not mention it again.

Instead she got this shocked look on her face, and gave me the biggest hug ever. Then started crying and told me that in the 3 years she's been in the UK, noone has ever gone to the trouble of learning any Kazakh, not even her closest friends, or boyfriends. The rest of the afternoon she kept hugging me and telling anyone who'd listen how I greeted her in Kazakh.

I'm really glad I was able to make her happy, but I have never been so surprised and embarrassed in my life :)"
31,0,"Hello people! Tell me something about yourself that you may view as not so positive and allow your dear OP to change your way of thinking by putting a truly positive spin on said trait.

EDIT: it may take me a while but I promise to get around to spinning positively for each and every one of you awesome people!"
32,0,"So I was telling an acquaintance about this and he thought it was pretty interesting, so I thought I would share it with you guys.

About 6 years ago my friend and I were on our way to pick up another friend from work at around 10pm. He was the driver and I was the passenger. We approach the intersection of my friends work traveling about 55mph (88kph) and as we’re entering the intersection a girl on her phone ran the red light at about 70mph (113kph) and we T-boned her. My seatbelt ripped the buckle from its housing and I went through the windshield.

I’m awake and conscious. I stand up and reach for my phone in my pocket; my arm feels like it’s on fire but I get my phone out and dial 911 through the lock screen. I look down and I’m pouring blood onto the street, as in a nice steady stream is making a puddle. People that had seen the accident, including the friend we were picking up, stop and watch me in horror as I walk around and hand my now blood covered phone my friend who is still stuck in the car. He takes it and I proceed to lean against the car.

An ambulance shows up, straps me to a board, and starts to load me into the back. As the as the stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance my mom showed up at the scene of the accident. I never saw her but I heard her yell ""I love you, *****,” I tried really hard but I wasn't able to reply.

While I was in the ambulance, I started feel odd and, although it’s weird to say, I could tell that my body was giving up on me. 

In the beginning my fingers started to go numb, at first in the pins and needles sense and then I couldn't feel them at all. I remember touching them with my thumbs and thinking about how weird it was. My vision blurred and would go in and out of blackness. I coughed out a ""thank you"" and for some reason an ""I'm sorry"" to the person who was working on me in the ambulance. I closed my eyes and I thought about my how my friend would probably blame himself and how my Mom would handle it (I was 21 and still lived with her.) My body started to feel really light, and I tried to touch my thumbs to my fingers again but my hands wouldn't move. Everything seemed quiet to me, I could see that the person was trying to talk to me but it was like I was selectively tuning him out. Instead I could hear my heart beat steadily getting further and further apart.

My final though was ""I wish I had replied to her."" (referring to my mom's ""I love you."") After that everything went black, just like falling asleep.

I was defibrillated, and let me tell you, it’s a total sensory overload. It’s like being kicked in the chest, it tastes and smells like hot copper, you see a blinding white flash, and you hear an enormous BANG all at the same time.

After I was defibrillated I had 4 shots of Epinephrine to make my heart beat steady. The guy in the ambulance was literally crying because I had apologized to him before he had lost me. I later found out that my heart had stopped for 113 seconds.

Not an experience that I’d recommend to anybody, but interesting to know about nonetheless.

Edit 2: I appreciate you're interest everybody but I'm living in Japan and it's about the time for bed. Feel free to ask more questions and I'll do my best to answer you when I wake up or get a free minute at work!

Aaaaand its morning.

-------------- The Big Bad List of Edits --------------


This thread got way more attention that I had ever thought it would. Thanks for the support everyone, and a big thanks to the person who gave me gold! It’s the first time I’ve ever gotten it.

I’m going to address some of the common questions I’ve been receiving with this edit. I’ll try to reply to all of you but it may take me a bit. This edit list will probably also grow steadily.

1.	I understand that some of you are skeptical and that’s okay, it’s hard to take in. I am not, nor have I ever been, a medical professional; so I am only able to tell you what happened through what I remember and what I was told in layman's terms, take it as you will. I assure you that it really did happen though.

2.	My primary injuries were major cuts to my face, shoulder, and neck; a torn muscle in my back (my trapezius) on the right side, and I compressed the spinal nerve that runs to my right arm. I had lost about 3 - 4 pints of blood and had some minor brain swelling. I still have full control of the arm and my only lasting side effect is neck that gets sore really easily. 

3.	I didn’t have any kind of out of body experience. I really fought for consciousness, when I started to lose control of my senses I knew it was a losing battle. 

4.	I did not see Jesus, nor did I see the flames of hell. There also wasn’t a “light at the end of the tunnel” experience for me.

5.	I don’t know what happened to the driver of the other car in a legal sense. I know from the police report that she survived. I did sue her insurance after they offered to pay only half of my medical bills. I won easily.

6.	If you want to use this story or any of my comments in a positive way, feel free.

7. I did get to to reply to my mom in the hospital. I told her that I had heard her yell to me and she started to cry a lot. I gave her a thumbs up because it was pretty much the movement that I could manage. It was so awkward that she laughed about it.

33,0,"We don't live together but I stay at his place very often. He works from home so when I'm having my shower he'll get up and make us both coffee.

He has an aeropress so he'll make one cup, rinse it out, make the next cup.

This morning when I got to the bottom of the cup I got a mouthful of coffee grinds, I reacted to this surprise and he said *""Oh, I gave you the wrong cup""*.

I asked why he has grinds at the bottom of his cup and he told me that it happens when the aeropress hasn't been dried out properly and he just takes the second crappy cup and gives me the nice one.

Such a small thing but I found it really thoughtful and was so touched by it (is that lame?).

What are small but very sweet things that your partners do for you?"
34,0,"They'll claim that everything that happened on """"Earth"""" was made up and all images of it were photoshopped.

I feel like this will happen because, you know, *humans.*"
35,0,"I get it. By being a leader, you show that you have strength to take on responsibilities, command, etc. I don't want that. I want to just follow. Growing up, I had to take care of finances and making sure everyone put their share of rent, I had to make sure to wake my sisters up. I had a supervisor stint at work for a bit. I don't like the responsibility. I want to just follow for a bit and sit on the passenger seat. "

38,0,"So, I contributed to the Cards Against Humanity Saves America thing a few weeks ago. Yesterday, I received my third envelope. Apparently I am one of the 10,000 poorest contributors to the campaign, so CAH sent me $15 to fight wealth inequality. lol. I'd like to take a moment to thank my career in social work for this $15.

So, CC anything cool and unexpected happen to you lately? "
39,0,"I, a male of 20 years of age just had my first kiss this evening. It was surreal, as if it wasn’t even happening until it was over. Now I’m sitting here stone dead tired and still shaking and smiling. Happy days!

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words it makes me smile reading each comment. Yes, I am straight so it was a girl! And to everyone still waiting, keep being yourself and the right person will come by for you!"
40,0,Name a random American you think would make a good President. It doesn't have to be anyone famous! 
41,0,"Just thought this was kinda funny. She is from Ukraine, so her English isn't perfect, but it's pretty good. We met on Tinder and went on a couple dates. We basically had this conversation:

> Her: ""Do you want to date with me?""

> Me: ""You mean do I want to date you?""

> Her: ""Yeah""

And I said yes.

I thought it was kinda soon, I hadn't planned on asking her out for a little while, but I said yes anyway because that's where it felt like it was going. It seemed kinda silly to me to artificially say ""no"" when I had already planned on asking her at some point anyway. The next morning I updated my Facebook relationship status (because you know, life revolves around Facebook) and she accepted it. 

Well, turns out she wasn't asking me to be her boyfriend, she was just asking if I wanted to continue going on dates with her. She had met some previous guys on Tinder that ghosted her so she was just asking if I wanted to continue hanging out, basically. 

While I had thought that she asked *me* out, she thought I had asked *her* out in a really lame way by updating my Facebook relationship status, but said didn't think much of it and just rolled with it. She's pretty laid back, that's one of the reasons that I like her. 

I didn't find out this miscommunication for a while but now that I know, it's kind of embarrassing. Either way, we both just laughed at it, and now we're dating so that's pretty cool."
42,0,"So I recently started college. Prior to the start of the semester, I had never tried coffee. I thought I should give it a chance and have been trying several types to try to find something I like.

Almost all the types I tried were disgusting. It tasted nothing like it smelled, making me think that perhaps I was fighting a losing battle. Then I discovered the coffee they were serving at the cafeteria.

When I first tasted it,  I was in heaven. This wasn't the bitter, gag-inducing liquid I had been forcing myself to gulp down; in fact, it hardly tasted like coffee at all. I knew this creamy drink lay on the pansy end of the spectrum, but I saw it as my gateway drug into the world of coffee drinkers.

I tried to look up the nutrition information so I could be aware and better control my portions. It was labelled as 'French Vanilla Supreme' on the machine, but I could only find creamer of that name. I figured that was just the name the school decided to give it. 

I was just sitting down thinking about all the things that didn't add up: its taste and consistency, the fact that it didn't give me a caffeine buzz, the fact it was served in a different machine than the other coffee and wasn't even labelled as coffee. All this lead to my epiphany--- that I haven't been drinking coffee at all; I've been drinking 1-2 cups of creamer a day. I feel like an idiot. 

tl;dr: Tried to get into coffee, ended up drinking a shit ton of creamer"
43,0,"For the first time in 2 years I am employed!

I was finishing my degree until just a few months ago, and for most of my time in school I wasn't able to find a job since I lived in an area that was oversaturated with unqualified students looking for hourly work at restaurants and such. Then these past SIX months I've been legitimately too sick to even consider working.. until literally just a few days ago!!

I've been going through very expensive and invasive tests these last few months and we're finally starting to figure out what's wrong with me, and I'm finally on medication that helps. For less than a week now I've been pain free and able to live my life like a normal healthy person, which is already so incredible for me since I'd forgotten what it felt like to feel capable and self reliant.

Just a few days ago I decided to go ahead and apply for a job at a nice restaurant up the street, but I wasn't getting my hopes up since I've gotten so used to being rejected from all the jobs I've applied to these past few years. But just yesterday I was interviewed and officially offered the job, and I start next week!

I haven't been this happy in such a long time that I don't even remember. I'd completely lost faith in myself and now I actually feel OPTIMISTIC for my future, maybe for the first time ever. Which is kind of scary and unfamiliar. I even baked a huge cake today! I'm just so happy to be employed that I start crying when I think about it :')

EDIT: WOW I was gone for Easter and just logged back in, and I am so amazed and grateful at how much positive support I'm getting!! Thank you all so much, I've been going through a tough time lately not having any friends and being sick all the time, and I feel a lot less alone now, as silly as that might sound. You guys are the best :)"
44,0,"He thinks I'm still asleep and I can hear him having a fight with Alexa. While he was in the kitchen he asked her to play Tom Petty on Spotify and she responded with her usual ""Playing songs by Tom Petty from Spotify"" and then she didn't. Then I heard him storming from the kitchen into the living room shouting ""No you're not you lying bitch!"". 
It's like we live with a moody teenager sometimes, this has made my morning and I cannot stop laughing!

Do you use Alexa? If so what craziness have you found yourself doing because of her?"
45,0,"What is that even called? Just empathy? Like I know if you watch something gory you can get sympathy pain. Sympathy embarrassment?


Edit: So it looks like a lot of other people have this issue too. It's nice to know I'm not weird - or at least not alone in my weirdness. I can't possibly reply to everyone but I've been looking over my inbox; some replies are insightful, others just conversational. The thing I want to point out though is that there are hundreds of comments here and not ONE is negative or telling me how much I suck or describing my mother's sex life. I wanted to say thank you for that. It's very uncommon online in my experience and I hope it stays that way. This sub really is something special."
46,0,"[This](https://youtu.be/O2s1r3dnJeo) is the noise I'm talking about. The video specifies Brits but it's definitely not just them.

I especially notice that the people I work with in food service make this noise the most. I never hear it when I'm out and about or when I went to school. Have any of y'all ever noticed this?

Edit: A lot of y'all chiming in from the Midwestern US and Canada, but I'm from Texas. I'm wondering when we all started shortening ""oops"" into ""oop"" lol."
47,0,"It would be casual, a bit like this subreddit, except only 2, at most 3, people would come together together to talk, probably via DM.

It would also be a bit like having a penpal, except with penpals there's generally an expectation that you'd have interesting things to say, that you'd write a certain amount, reply a certain amount. Here there would be no such expectation. You can write as little or as much as you like, on totally boring subjects, and the other person would be under no obligation to reply with anything other than an acknowledgement, like, ""that sucks, hope you're feeling better,"" or, ""that's cool.""

What do you think? Would it work? Maybe it needs thinking through a bit more. Something you'd be interested in participating in?"
48,0,"At first I was shocked at how easy it was, and how far I didn't have to go in order to just... be somewhere and someone else, where no one knew me, and I was new again. I am from a small town of < 20k, so I was used to everybody knowing everyone and everyone knowing everybody's business-- including mine. Which made my crumbling marriage and soon-to-be divorce all the less palatable to my mid-twenties mindset. I knew she was leaving, so when she walked out the door for good, I decided rather than hear and be disposed to the gossip of town that I would Don Draper this life. Well... minus ID fraud.


I didn't show up to work the next day, or ever again. Instead I woke up that morning, showered, and collected myself. Water pouring down my face concealing tears I counted out my steps. Mirror-facing and toothbrush askew in my mouth I collected my thoughts. Shoes tied and binds unbound I begged myself for resolve. Cigarette lit and phone in hand I called my landlord and broke the lease. 


Now, what do I do with all this shit I can't take with me? Next phone call was a storage company. Wait, how do I get it all there? Next phone call, U-haul. Oh good, they were right down the street. I walked to it.

I returned and started, almost literally, just tossing the unnecessary shit of my life into it. 


Couch can't fit in my car. In it goes. 


TV isn't going with me, in it goes. 


Look at all these clothes, and look at all hers! In they went. 


*Man... fuck this bed. My back hurts. Fuck you bed, you're not coming with me.*


My ex-wife and I didn't have much, we led minimalist lifestyles. I remember the exact moment I drew the door shut on that storage unit and clamped the lock down. *That's step one.*


I filled my car to the brim with what I considered necessities. Guitar? Check. Clothes I'd need? Check. Laptop? Check. All that shit. I remember thinking it looked like I was homeless. *Oh shit. I am homeless.* Actually, the thought made me smile. Anyway.

Buzz. *Facebook notification? Oh.. delete this shit.* I deleted it all. No Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter, no SnapChat, no LinkedIn, nothing. All of it, gone. And not just off my phone. The accounts were all deleted. It's like I was never there, digitally or in the flesh. *That's step two.*

Drove down to the landlord's house and returned the keys. *That's step three.* Another phone call. *Hi, yes I need to disconnect the electricity at 123 CleverFeather St. Yes. Yes. Billing address? Uh... 123 CleverFeather's Ex-Wife's Mom's St. Yes. Thank you.""* I thought that was cheeky.


Returned the U-haul and then I drove. No goodbyes. No parting text messages. As quickly as I arrived, I was gone even quicker. It was night at this point. I was a nomad. I remember careening down the interstate at one point and just howling at the moon with what felt like a new lease on life. *I'm free. I'm free. I'm free.*


I stopped driving after what felt like forever and the blink of an eye. I felt punchdrunk, engorged on possibility. *Nashville? Hm. Alright let's set up here.* I had been here a couple of times. I pulled in the back parking lot of a bar I had been to once because a band I liked said they had been there before. Silly reasons were the best reasons at the moment.


I looked at my phone. I had a couple of texts from friends asking if I wanted to go to our favorite bar that night. A missed call from another person. I never returned the texts. In the coming weeks those messages would increase in urgency and relevance. 

Buzz. *Where are you?* 


Buzz. *Did you delete me on Facebook?* 


Buzz. *What the fuck man?* 


Buzz. *Are you and her splitting up? What's going on?*


Buzz. *This is fucked up. No one knows what happened to you.*


Everyone, everything reminded me of her. I had to do this for me. Selfishly. If that was BC, this is AD. I had $800 in my bank account. I was going to make this work. I had to. The bar had free wifi, pretty slow but quick enough to sift through craigslist for rooms for rent. I found a couple. *Message sent.*


I remember walking up the ramp that led into the bar, and reveling in what I had done. The air was different, it was a city after all. The people were faceless, just as I was now. It was a Thursday night in October. It was brisk. I walked in and sat down at the bar, there were a few people here and there. Some I remember seeing and little did I know I would come to call them my friends in time.


*Hey stranger, what are you drinkin'?*


""I'll have a bourbon on the rocks. My name is CleverFeather, by the way. Nice to meet you.""


I smiled."
49,0,"So after much persistence from my friends, I finally joined reddit and the first thing after my username is Karma points. Some subreddits won't even let me post until I have enough Karma.
So can anyone explain to me what these Karma points are and how to get them.

50,0,I think this is the first time I've ever said that. Anyways I just came to say that I think I've finally been able to accept the fact that I'm gay. I'm still not ready to tell friends and family but hopefully I will be eventually. Just wanted to get that out there since I heard saying it to yourself can help.

52,0,"It's weird to think that, because of this and other similar perspective differences between then and now, one's entire childhood consisted of much different situations than one experienced as a child. Like, these events happened and I was present for them, but the things I remember and the things that happened in reality might be sooo different."
53,0,"On Monday I was sitting at my desk at work, realizing that a relationship that I've been involved in off and on for 2.5 years was going to end and that, overall, I just was not a happy guy. When it became clear that it was over something in me snapped, I bought a one way ticket to Southern California for Saturday, got up, and left. I emailed my boss about an hour later to say I was done. EVERYBODY said I was crazy, impulsive, rash, etc. Since then I have gotten a job in my same industry with higher pay and 100% telecommuting and found a place 1.5 blocks from a popular beach near San Diego. I fly out in 2 days and get to be a completely new me. Anybody else ever done something like this?

Edit: OK this kinda blew up, thank you all for the encouragement, yes I'd like to meet you all if I can, but give me a couple days to get back as I am in the midst of coordinating my move. I will be in Encinitas (sorry nitpickers, I know that's not technically San Diego) and am very much looking forward to exploring and being able to be outside a much greater percentage of the time. Cheers!"
54,0,"I live in a decent suburban town south of the city where I work. I take the train to work and to get to the train station, I can take a walking path that's a few houses down, which cuts through the woods, past a pond, leading you all of the way to the train platform--super convenient. It's usually the best part of my day. I don't turn on my music yet or listen to any podcasts, I just enjoy this 15-minute walk through nature in the morning. What kind of kills it though, for whatever reason, (mostly because humans suck) right where the path begins (and where a few vehicles can park) there is a buttload of trash. And still plenty of trash in the surrounding woods down the whole path. 

On Friday morning when I reached the platform I decided to order a $15 trash picker on amazon. Ever since that moment I was so excited to...pick up trash. I got it yesterday afternoon (damn, amazon) and immediately began the clean up. It's weird but I had SO much fun. I would've went for longer but I ran out of room in the trash bag and paper bag that I brought.

I think it's so great for me because I like to be outside and enjoy nature, but because I don't have a dog to walk, I always feel weird just being a big dude walking around with my hands in my pocket. People always get that, please don't bother/mug me vibe when I walk past a dog walker or jogger. It gives me something to do on these walks and gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment. 

I'm annoyed because it snowed last night and now I can't continue the process. The area around the train tracks and the station is absolutely horrific. Even though there are some trash cans on this long platform, people obviously still chuck them into the weeds behind the platform. 

I'm going to need more trash bags."
55,0,"Not too many people in my life seem to care that much, but I’m really excited and proud of myself. It’s one of the most challenging things I’ve accomplished, and I just wanted to put it out there somewhere. 

It’s crazy, I never realized how bad I smelled, how much people would wait for me to smoke before we did anything, or how often I was sick or moody until I gave it up and saw life through the lens of a non smoker again. 

EDIT: WOW! Gold! Thank you so much kind stranger, and to everyone for the overwhelming support. I honestly thought I might get one person reply with something like “cool go u” I had no idea I would get so many inspiring stories and such incredible support for not just me but everyone in here. Y’all just gave me so much faith in humanity today. You rock. "

58,0,"I am a fairly handsome guy, I am athletic, confident and outgoing. Also, I'm 6 feet tall and have added some quality pictures on tinder (mind you, no selfies).
I never had problems meeting women in real life. However, tinder never worked for me they way it did for my friends. (6 matches after two weeks and only two (one word) replies.) The first thought that came to my mind was: ""Well, maybe I'm not as good looking as I think I am."" But that did not explain the fact that a lot of lesser attractive guys got exponentially more matches than me.   

Yesterday, I had a conversation with my roommate about this, and he suggested that my middle-eastern name might be the reason for fewer matches.   
So I did a little experiment: 
I changed my name from ""Ahmad"" to ""Nick"". Everything else was the same (the bio, pictures, age, height, etc.). I swiped right on all profiles in both scenarios. 

Behold, I am on the 4th day and have already got 28 matches.  
It's sad... but , fuck it. I am Nick, going forward. 
Edit: Grammar"
59,0,"Not going to go into too much detail about my personal life, but for the longest time I was one of those people who would stay up until 1-2am then head to uni at 9:30-10. Now that I'm a bit older and have a career of sorts, the 6-4:30 work hours have made it so that I can't really afford the luxury of doing that. On a whim one day a few months back, I decided to get up at 5 on my off-day and do what I'd typically do only earlier (grocs, jog, yardwork) and haven't regretted it since.

For starters, the early time means that the city area is mostly 'dead' making tasks way easier, with the time it's taken me to do groceries being reduced by about 10mins or so and my jogging route rarely being hindered by traffic now. The older people I've run into doing both have also been incredibly friendly with most of them saying hello as I've passed by them. There's also the relaxing feeling of it being midday and already having all of the annoying daily stuff being done.

So yeah, that's all I really wanted to say. If anyone has any other questions, feel free to toss'm out there. "
60,0,"Can't go into detail because of doxxing, but I whistle blew on my manager who had ""mismanaged"" a few million dollars. Money that would have gone towards medical equipment and hiring more nurses/doctors. They will never know what I did and I will never be able to be thanked, but that bitch is going the fuck down. Multiple team members are now threatening resignation since I was the highest performing employee in our shift. I'm so proud of what I did and it makes my anxiety attacks from unemployment worth it. I planned for months and collected evidence, and had an emergency minimum wage job ready in case I did get fired. I knew whistleblowers got shit-canned. I'll probably lose my apartment and had to cancel all of my subscriptions and donations, making 1/3rd of what I did will be hard but I'm confident I'll have a good job again in a few months.

I'm happy about my choices, and I'll tell my grandkids if I have them about the time I stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. What pissed me off the most is real people in power could have stopped it, but no, a level 1 grunt had to put their first good job on the line. Fuck em all :).

EDIT: Holy shit

61,0,"I found out the woman who did it was an elderly lady who was the grandma of my daughter’s classmate. Putting a smile on my kids’ faces during such a dark time while being in a financial mess was the most unbelievable act of kindness. From a stranger. Good people exist. We documented the date with pictures and colorings for her, little prizes from the arcade, and I will forever be grateful. I never ask for help or share my woes, and it was hard to accept...but I did. Like a blubbering idiot. We took that experience to pay it forward during our hard time because no matter what, there are always people dealing with a situation worse than your own. We were poor but there were people who had less than us. Kindness is truly contagious. Kindness doesn’t need to cost anything. Thoughtfulness is free. ❤️"
62,0,"I worked really hard on a paper and it got called out today first thing in class of “what not to do”. The teacher excluded my name and other identifying information but he said that the paper was from someone in the class. 

I felt like cold water was being poured down my back, a prickling sensation all over my body, my cheeks burning up, and my stomach was churning. A girl laughed which made me feel worse. 

I wrote the paper as best I could, went to the teacher for help, asked for more help over email but each time the teacher just blew me off. I asked other classmates for help too but no one really seemed to understand the paper instructions either. More than half the class did not do well either. 

It just felt awful to have my paper called out and used as a prime example of “what not to do”. What a great way to start a Monday. "

So one weekend two of his Turkish friends were visiting him from Austria, and when we started chatting I asked one of his friends where he was from Turkey. And he said this small town, where barely 150 people live. Turns out he lives in the same town where my grand parents live and where I used to go every year. I couldn´t  believe it and asked him a couple of questions. He got everything right. Then finally I asked him if he knew my uncle, because they´re the same age. He told me he was friends with my uncle. Biggest mindfuck I have ever had. He lived in the house in front of my grandparents house. Of all the  towns he could live from in Turkey, he lived in the same one as me and my grandparents do."

Edit: Prom is over. I had an exhilarating run of investigation and secret agentry. I probably disturbed and confused many hotel workers, but it was well worth it. My travels took me to life threatening areas, life *creating* events (if you know what I mean) and some pretty mysterious places. I'd highly recommend it next time you're bored in a hotel. To all those saying the ""friends"" and my gf are in the wrong here, I agree. I was trying to make the best of a bad situation, so I appreciate your words of support. I'll probably talk to her about it. Hopefully I'll return back to the hotel soon to finally discover what's behind the final door... I know at the very least it's the roof, but it could be something much, much cooler. Have an awesome day! 

Edit 2: you guys are awesome &amp;lt;3 thank you for your kind words. For those wondering... yes, I got laid. It was my secret agent duty. Also pics are coming soon (not of that last statement :P of the red ladder and the high frequency room).

Thanks to /u/countingchris, whose friend's mom works at the hotel, supposedly that area of the hotel is HAUNTED and guests aren't allowed up there!

69,0,"We're gay. We went to a party last night and were often holding hands or had our arms around each other. We sat on each other at some points. We walked down the street holding hands or with our arms around each other too. Passed several people on the street and didn't get assaulted, any insulting comments, or any dirty looks. We didn't face any problems at the party either even though we only knew a few other people there, and we had no idea how the rest would react.

It feels like such a luxury to be able to do this. I couldn't help but think what would've happened a few decades ago, or what would happen just if we were in a different location in the world now. It's scary to think of what could happen, but I feel so fortunate to have been able to do it with no issues."
70,0,"So I'm a junior in college now, but when I was in high school, I was bullied for being Jewish. Never anything physical, or deriving from anything malicious, but just bullied. So yesterday, the main perpetrator reached out to me and asked me to give him a call. I'm not sure why, but in the back of my head, I felt like I knew what the conversation was going to be about. He had never been a bad kid; he was just a goofball, but back then, it didn't really matter. I was lonely, practically friendless, and really physically immature for my age. I was isolated. And I guess he picked up on that, and saw me as an easy punching bag, incapable of punching back. The worst part is that deep in my heart, I really wanted to be friends with this guy. I thought we had a lot in common, and shared a similar sense of humor. He hung out with the cool kids, I didn't hang out with anybody. So I would take the abuse, hoping that by weathering the blows, I'd somehow become buddies with him. But we never did.

Anyway, so I give him a call today, feeling a bit apprehensive. I knew he would be nice on the phone, because deep down, he was always a good kid. So we're doing some small-talk, and I finally just say, ""What did you want to talk to me about?"" He paused, and then told me how upset and infuriated he feels about all the hate in the world, especially in the current American political climate. He loathes racism and bigotry, but has always felt like a hypocrite. He told me that, every now and again, he thinks about how he treated me, how he made the Jew jokes for the laughs and because he knew I wouldn't fight back. Then he started to sound a bit choked up, and just said ""I'm sorry."" And, just like that, I forgave him. It's not like I'm a push-over, but I knew that he really, really meant it, and I respected the hell out of him for making amends. I told him that, at the time, he did a lot of damage to my self-esteem and my psyche, but I'm alright now. Then we agreed that next time we were in the city, we'd meet up. I'm actually looking forward to it. Maybe we'll finally become friends.

I don't know why I felt the need to share this. It's just kicked up a lot of memories and feelings I thought were in the past, and now I'm not sure how to cope with them. Anyway, thanks for reading. If anyone has a similar story, I'd love to hear it."

74,0,"Major lurker on reddit for the last few years but this seems worth posting about


So i was laying in bed with the wife at about midnight. She was fast asleep and i was almost there when i heard my doorbell ring. I get out of bed and go down the hall to the front and ask who's there.  Some girl says her name is Allie. So i crack the door open to see what the deal was. Long story short she and her BF tell me their truck is stuck in a ditch down the road and asked if i could help them pull it out (with my truck that was parked in the driveway). Okay... I've been there so i agree and tell them to give me a minute to get dressed.


They seemed a little sketchy so i was wary from the get-go. But hey i'm sure i look a little sketchy to some people too, and the town i live in has a high poverty level and i was way below it for many years myself, so i tried not to judge to hard and just help.


Anyways we get in my truck and everything seems chill. We're talking about how they have a 2 year old and i have 3 kids myself.  I get close to where they told me their truck was and i see a couple cop cars stopped at it checking it out with their lights on. The first thing these people say is ""oh fuck, keep going!"" 


I was a dumb kid once and had my share of run-ins with the law over doing stupid dumb kid stuff. I ask them what they got in the truck. The guy says they have a pit bull in the truck. Okay... I don't buy that for a second because there is nothing illegal about that in this town. It wasn't worth the way they were acting.


So I drive past their truck and immediately one of the cop cars start following and i'm telling these kids that we are gonna get pulled over and they beg me to tell the cops that's not their truck. I tell them I'm going to tell the cops exactly what happened of course because I don't know you people, sorry bout your luck.


Sure enough the lights come on for us to pull over so i stop my truck right there and kill it. This is where stuff gets a little crazy. Worth mentioning at this point I notice the guy shoving something under my seat. I assumed it was drugs.


I roll down my windows as the officer is getting out of his car and i hear the very distinct sound of a round being chambered in a weapon. The officer puts on his authoritative voice and tells everyone to show their hands. He then orders the driver (me) to get out of the truck and keep facing away from him with my hands in the air and slowly walk backwards till he says to stop. When he stops me he tells me to get on my knees. He asks me who's in the vehicle and what's going on.


I tell him straight up these kids knocked on my door, said they were stuck, then freaked when they saw the cops. He's very reasonable and professional. Tells me he's going to detain me until he gets this figured out. So he handcuffs me and sets me in the back of the squad car. I'm not freaking out or anything myself because i live a block away and it can be verified easily that I was just being a good samaritan.  


He then goes and gets the guy out of my truck, handcuffs him and puts him in the back of the car with me while he goes and gets the girl.  I turn and look at the guy and say ""what the fuck man? I'm just trying to help someone out and ya'll got me handcuffed in the back of a cop's car with a rifle drawn on me.""  

The kid was very apologetic to me and says he swears he don't know whats going on. I tell him no big deal, shit goes south sometimes and I know I'm in the clear. 


After the officer talks to the girl he cuffs her and puts her in the backseat after getting me out. He tells me they verified what i said and tells me that the truck that was stuck is stolen out of Kansas! He then asks me if i own a revolver and asks that if he goes and looks in my truck and finds a pistol that it definitely wouldn't be mine. I tell him no sir i only own rifles and they are locked up at home. He asks for permission to check in my truck and i give it to him. 


I kid you not he went right to where the guy was sitting looks under the seat and comes back with that pistol he asked about within 15 seconds. So not only did they ask for help with a stolen vehicle, this dude had a freaking fully loaded .38 special in his pocket too. 


The cop kids around with me a bit and says 'no good deed goes unpunished, huh?'. I give him my information and phone number in case he needs an official statement from me. He thanks me for cooperating and sends me home. That was all the information i got about those two though I'm sure they are going to the county jail for awhile.


I get home, open a beer and tell the wife about the exciting last thirty minutes of my life. She reacts accordingly and tells me I'm not allowed to help strangers in the middle of the night again. I finally get back to sleep for about two hours and now i'm sitting here typing this up in a sleep deprived and adrenaline fueled daze.

I know this got long and thanks to anyone that made it this far. I just thought the lovely people here would like to hear this and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.



TL;DR
    Got woke up in the middle of the night. Thought i would help someone get their truck unstuck the way i have been helped before. Ended up getting an AR pointed at me, handcuffed and put in the back of a cop car for awhile.

I get done in the bathroom and I go out into the living room, and there he is... Just sitting on the little patch of tile I have inside my front door.  I go over and I open the door for him and he heads back outside.  I guess he's off to do whatever mice like to do early on Saturday morning.  Maybe get a bagel and a latte?  I have no idea.

A few things:

I have a hard time concentrating. I suggest [the Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for time management. I refuse to take ritalin or anything else along those lines, it's not for me. I just deal with it.

I don't take notes unless I have to, I used [mind mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) because reading notes sucks and stuff gets smeared, scratched out, lost, can't read my writing, etc. <- I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO THIS. Practice it first and develop your own method of doing it. It makes studying faster and prettier. 

This is probably irrelevant but I am a lady not a sir. "

Edit:

Okay, so wow! Thanks everyone! I've been trying to respond to all the comments. But really thank you guys!

A lot of people are asking. I basically decided one day I was just going to quit. I had somewhat of an epiphany one night laying in bed and really, truly thinking about what I was doing to myself and my body. What was I going to look like in 20 years if I kept smoking? How would my voice sound? Would I have cancer? Would I even be alive?! Yeah, it really hit me! I also lost a ton of excess weight and quit biting my nails within the last two or so years, so checking the ""quit smoking"" box off of my bad habits list really hit the nail on the head for creating a healthy lifestyle for myself. I DO use an ecigarette, but I've only been using 3mg nicotine for the last 6 or so months and will eventually drop the habit all together.

If you're struggling, think of it the way I did. You are hurting yourself! Find a new hobby or a good habit to replace the bad ones in your life. Distract yourself with positive things. Have a good support system and surround yourself with good vibes and healthy relationships. I'm just one person out of probably millions who have quit smoking.

You can do it! Drop your cigarette! Do it now!

EDIT: Slept on it last night, and was amazed to see all the responses. Would be a bit mean to say, but am glad that I am not the only one who feels this is true. 
Some key takeaways that I got from the comments below-

1. Majority of the people feel lonely in this age range (give or take 5), but they tend to do something about it or else loneliness really gets to their mind

2. Almost everyone suggested to get a 'hobby'. Now I have heard this A LOT, but I really did not know where or how to start (until now). One of the comments that I found helpful in this regard was ""get three kind of hobbies - one which is for yourself and only serves as your outlet (sketching, gym, etc.), one which helps you meets people, and one which gives some sort of secondary income (however small)"". Now again, there might be some personal bias to the way I see it, but I just thought it would be nice to mention it.

3. For people who do not want to get a hobby (social interaction can be overwhelming at times), they usually try to stay inside and play video games. This came out as a common theme

4. Some also suggested volunteering, as it is peaceful, and you get to meet new people

5. Based on the comments below, can confirm that this happens with girls as well

6. A significant percentage of people are enjoying their time alone in their late 20s/early 30s. A common theme here is that ""they get time to do things they want""

Some comments said that they are still in their late teens, and this post terrifies them. I am really sorry, but I did not intend to do that. You never know, life might turn out interesting for you as you age :)
Will keep on updating the list as I find more gems of wisdom! Thank you everyone for sharing :)"
94,0,"Within a month of my wife and I dating, I bought myself my first brand new car. It was a 2004 Subaru Forester, and I loved that thing. It had a unique body style, in that there was no frame over the windows (like [this](http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/vehicle-pictures/2003/subaru/forester/1177-037-driver-side-door-open-480.jpg)). After I was done taking my now-wife for her first ride in it, she got out of the car, grabbed the top part of the glass, and shoved the door closed by the glass.

I was in shock- I wanted to tell her not to slam the door by the glass, but since we had just started dating, I didn't want to seem like a neurotic prick about my car. I had to think of a plan...

So the next day we went somewhere else. When we arrived at our destination, I stopped her from getting out. ""No, no"" I said. ""Let me get the door for you."" Boy, was she impressed. And I got the door for her the next time, and the next, and every other time for going on 12 years.

Its 3am here in Britain and I'm developing a minor headache so need to go to sleep xD I don't know if mods can take over this thread and update it instead, if they want to/can do that I invite them to do so. The best place to get information on this right now is the [summary on /r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/) and the [live coverage going on right now](https://np.reddit.com/live/v6d0vi6c8veb). Goodnight everyone!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, as of right now, starting with /r/IAmA, multiple default subreddits including /r/science and /r/movies have gone private. The widely publicised reason is that the person who handled all IAmA's on multiple subreddits, Victoria, was fired by Reddit with no warning whatsoever to the mods.

I've decided to post here because I kinda don't know where else to discuss this :S What on earth is going on? I'm afraid this has a very serious possibility of causing Reddit as we know it to collapse in on itself and we'll all have to emigrate to another website :(

Edit: Welp, this thread just turned into a megathread. I suddenly feel somewhat exposed. o_o Since I feel like I have some responsibility to make this look at least somewhat presentable...

EDIT: I'm afraid I'm getting rather overwhelmed here guys/gals. I'll keep updating the default subreddit list, but please expect the non-default list to not be up-to-date. Subreddits are shutting down left right and centre!

**Current list of default subreddits that have turned private includes:**

/r/IAmA 

/r/science 

/r/movies 

/r/gaming

/r/Askreddit

/r/Art

/r/history 

/r/listentothis has restricted submissions, although it hasn't shut down completely.

/r/videos

/r/gadgets 

/r/Music 

/r/books 

**Current list of non-default subreddits that have turned private includes:**

/r/circlejerk

/r/CrappyDesign 

/r/law

/r/spain 

/r/eatcheapandhealthy

/r/4chan

/r/fallout

Please let me know if you've noticed other subreddits that have gone dark and I'll add them to the list!

/r/OutOfTheLoop has a great summary megathread if you're confused about what the hell is going on, which [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/), and live coverage of The Darkening/AMAgeddon/Victoria's Secret/The Reddpocalypse [can be found here!](https://np.reddit.com/live/v6d0vi6c8veb)

97,0,I've never had a complete stranger ask me for one before. I was extremely honored and flattered that he enjoyed my drumming so much that he wanted one of my drumsticks (the dude even said he was gonna put it in his man cave!) I've played to 500 people before but playing this show to only around 20 people was so much more enjoyable because everyone there was super friendly and into the music. Definitely the best show we've ever played!!
98,0,"My dad was the most caring and giving man I know. He would literally give the shirt off his back for anyone. We had over 750 people come to his calling hours and collected hundreds of jars of peanut butter for homeless people in our area, with more jars still coming to us. It's such a great thing to see when it seems like all the main headlines in news today are tragedies. Just thought I'd share this story with you guys!

Thanks so much to everyone who wishes to donate more peanut butter. This is taking off much more than I ever hoped it would. Know a lot of people will benefit greatly from your generosity! "
99,0,"I have been hosting some Russian clients and their families for the past few days, we do full day boat trips in South  a Florida and usually provide lavish platters with snacks, cold meats and fruit, I freaked out for a second there thinking the platters where incomplete but after further observation I realised that they where all, from grandmother's to toddlers digging into the fruit platters like there was no tomorrow! 
I made a friendly comment along the lines of ""gee you guys really love my fruit platters"" but then one of the adults explained to me that in Russia, fruit is outrageously expensive and basically inaccessible to the general population, so when they come to the USA they really love eating fruit, 

The next few days I made MASSIVE platters with mangos and lychees and papaya and all sorts of amazing fruit in great quantities, they showed so much gratitude for that gesture it made me very happy to make them so happy,
I just can't imagine being somewhere where you can't afford fruit! 

And it brings me to my next point, what are things that maybe the general population take for granted but are difficult to get in other places?

100,0,"So I've just been out of a 6 year long relationship which didn't end the best way. I thought for the longest time I wouldn't be able to move on, but it's been about 3 weeks since it happened and yesterday I asked out a girl. It ended up not ending so well because she knew my ex-girlfriend and didn't want to complicate things - BUT, I actually managed to gather myself and ask someone who I found attractive out! 

I feel great, even though I don't have a date. Maybe soon!

How are the rest of you folks faring? "
101,0,"Story time. I lived in this crappy duplex right on the street most cities have that splits the nice side of town from the bad side of town. When I moved in there last year, this (I assumed) homeless woman knocked on the door late at night every few days asking for bread or cash or whatever. Usually gave her something to eat but I refused when she wanted money.

One day she comes by with what looks like the first lawnmower ever made, offers to cut my grass. Actually, yes, i'll pay you to do that. That's pay for a job, not a sob story handout, so yes. I don't understand how that shitty little mower even worked, but this woman cut the shit out of my yard. It's a tiny yard, so when she asked for 30 bucks I had to think about it; a bit high, but it was my fault for not agreeing to particulars before she did it, and I was trying to reward her for working and not begging. So we worked out a schedule where she would come by every other week. She even cut the neighbor's yard, doubling her money. 

Then she stopped coming for a few weeks. Turns out her ancient mower was stolen (where was she keeping it? was it even hers?). But instead of going back to begging, she pulled weeds and trimmed hedges for various people around the neighborhood, saved up and got a better mower. Eventually she had a moped with a ridiculous attachment to drag the mower around town, but the moped AND her mower were stolen, again. She went back at it, and soon she started showing up in a rusty old car with an even newer mower in the trunk. She even had a second mower and an ""employee"" who would cut grass in other neighborhoods. After 6 or 8 months of this, I was proud of her for sticking to her plan and seeing it blossom.

One night, around 4:30 am, I was still up studying for exams and I hear a familiar knock. Please don't tell me a third mower was stolen. I open up...she's on foot, looking disheveled, half a bottle of vodka in her hand. I'm all ready to hear any story she has cooked up, except for the one she actually has. ""I saw your lights on, I know you studying, figured you might could use a break. It's my 50th birthday today and I don't have anybody to celebrate with, nobody. You wanna sit on the porch and get drunk with me?""

So we sat on my porch and got drunk, watched the sunrise and the early risers driving to work, traded stories, laughed about how bitchy my neighbor was, talked about life. Without talking about her problems, she asked about mine, and I felt silly telling her my worries - I'm young, healthy, have a place and a car and a job and people know when my birthday is. I'm a mid-30's white male, and this homeless 50-year-old black lady made me realize how dumb I sound complaining just by asking how I was doing. She hugged me as she left and thanked me for just spending a little time with her.

If you're reading this on your smartphone, or sitting at home wondering what you WANT to eat, or dreading going to work tomorrow in the air conditioning, or rolling your eyes that someone just texted you who you aren't crazy about, take a second and appreciate that all of that is luxury. It's not your life, it's extra. Just by virtue of those things you are among the richest 10% of people on Earth (look it up).

Happy Monday, everybody. Wherever you are, thanks Angie.

104,0,"Back story - my wife and I are related through 2 marriages. Her sister is married to my uncles stepson.

We have a mutual family member that has developmental disabilities, and today was her birthday(as well as my wife's)!

We found out through the grapevine that no one in her family(to include parents, step parents and siblings) really wanted to spend time with her.

So yesterday my wife calls me from work and says we are going to take her out for brunch and some shopping.

We just got back and we had a blast! Got her some blueberry crepes and a new summer outfit. She was super happy to see us, and it really made her day(and mine)."
105,0,"Ever since High School, I was always good at small talk and making brief, casual conversation with people, but I sucked at making eye contact. So I made this a goal of mine to improve and several years later, I think it's one of my social strong suits. When I'm listening to someone or talking directly to them, I always make and maintain eye contact.

But this has made me realize how many people aren't used to that and how many people will look away mid-conversation or glance and look away uncomfortably. 

I think it's interesting how that works. We're like... afraid to just look directly at each other when talking. But I've noticed when I meet people that AREN'T uncomfortable with it, I have a stronger connection and can read the conversation a lot better.

Anyone else notice these things?

EDIT: Glad so many people can relate! Now I just need to work on remembering peoples’ names after they tell me the first time...

*EDIT 2: Since a lot of people are reading way too into this and commenting with some asinine and rude things, let me just clarify that I'm OBVIOUSLY not talking about making unwavering, deep eye contact with everyone I speak to and never looking away. Of course there are social conventions we need to observe and be sensitive to. Do you think I, as someone that used to be uncomfortable with this, is now unaware that these things can be difficult for people? Of course not. Read the room, read the situation you're in, and read the person you're talking to. There's so much more to good conversation than making eye contact, but I challenge anyone that struggles with social awkwardness to just try becoming a little more conscientious of their eye contact habits and see where they can improve. It's done nothing but help me in a lot of areas of my life.*"
106,0,"So as the title says I just learned about that combo! I'm from Germany and here (at least as far as I know) grilled cheese isn't a thing to begin with though tomato soup is.

107,0,"Don't really know what I wanted to say out of this, just wanted to share it. Pretty sure my grandmother didn't mean it in a harmful way when she laughed, but I think she laughed at how absurd it would be for me to become a DJ. Regardless, tomorrow night I'm playing an hour long set right before Dada Life, and I'm so fucking excited.

Edit : Did...did I really hit front page? Holy shit haha, that's incredible! Thank you all for the support, and I'll answer a few questions that people seem to be asking.

1. The gig is at Pacha U18, a night club located in Manhattan, NYC, that has an under 18 event every month or so. 
They were asking around for DJs, and I [sent them this message](http://imgur.com/Gzc1YGh&OO8B6j6), January 7th. Superbowl Sunday, as I was on my way to my friend's house for a superbowl party, I [get this text](http://i.imgur.com/OO8B6j6.png?1). From then, it was just info exchanges.

2. My soundcloud, after people asking, is [DeanTheDJ](https://soundcloud.com/dirty-vice-music). I have very old music on this, and it's not music that I'm proud of, haha. You can listen to some more recent work [here](https://clyp.it/0stcvmw5), which is some music that I enjoyed making as well as working on.

3. I'll be posting pictures and stuff tomorrow when I get back (currently 12:50 PM on Saturday, gotta start getting ready son haha). Thank you all for your support, I can't stress that enough, I'm scared shitless of messing up but you guys reassuring me has helped me so much <3

Edit 2 : Hey everyone! Sorry for the late edit, I've been exhausted and just playing video games and procrastinating in general haha, but here's what went down. I showed up at 4, doors opened at 5. Before the show began, I cashed out from the tickets I sold (sold 12 tickets, 30 each, for a total of $360, and my boss gave me $60 as my profit from the ticket selling. Easy money). After that, he pretty much escorted me backstage, let me put my stuff down, and said ""go party, come back at 6 when you're on"". My stage time was 6 - 7:30, then Dada Life was supposed to go live at 7:30 - 9ish. So, simple as that, I walked around until the show began, and just went to the mainstage and joined the crowd and started dancing.

After a while of some pretty cool music from some pretty cool DJs, I went to the basement (another set of DJs, very small crowd, if any) and greeted the DJ and made some chitchat for a while. Around 5:45 I went back to mainstage to get backstage, but there was a security guard that didn't let me go backstage. After explaining to him that I was on at 6 (currently 5:50), he still didn't budge. I asked him to radio my boss, but he said that my boss didn't carry a radio. Cue 5 minutes of endless frustration and texts to my boss (who rarely answers his texts, by the way). At the last minute, I decide to just start walking around and looking for him. I found him downstairs in the basement just chatting away with some group of guys. He looked at me like ""wtf, you're supposed to be playing any minute now"" and I just asked him to take me backstage. He escorted me there, but as I walked in, the security guard gave me a dirty look because he realized I was right. It's currently 6:02 / 6:03, and the DJ from 5-6 is still playing, so there's no real worries. Once behind the DJ currently playing, I gave him a tap on the shoulder and told him that he can kill his set after his next song (I'm a nice guy, I guess) and I'll take over from then.

Long story short, I went on and played some kickass music and the crowd loved it. At around 7:25, some guy taps me on the shoulder, and when I turn around, it's just some dude in a suit who tells me to kill the music completely after the song that goes past 7:30 ends (meaning, when the clock hits 7:30, let the song playing continue and end completely, then get off stage). I do exactly that, and when I turn around to get off stage (after grabbing my USBs from the turntables), I see Dada Life. Excited, I say hi and they thank me for my set and it's pretty much just a small exchange before they run to the stage. No huge meet and greet, didn't get to have a chat with them unfortunately, but it was still pretty cool to meet them. They offered me a banana though, which I thanked them for and accepted the kind offer, haha. I did get to enjoy their set too, but from the crowd (probably even better than being backstage). The night ends, and the next day I text my boss to thank him for the gig, and if he ever needs another opener, to feel free to text me, lol. 

So that's pretty much it, no cool pics of dada life unfortunately, but I do have some videos from the crowd, and if you guys want, I can go ahead and upload them all on youtube and link it here.

Thanks for reading this all, and I appreciate all the support you guys gave me, it definitely helped give me a confidence boost to rock that stage <3"

109,0,"After years of fighting mental illness, low self esteem, insecurities, and loneliness, I have finally reached happiness. I can feel it. I sat and cried for an hour while laughing and smiling bc happiness overpowered me. 

I finally realized I don’t need a significant other to be happy. I don’t need to rely on anything else for my own happiness. I have friends who act as a second family who are extremely protective of me. I reconnected with an old friend who is like a brother to me and we’re as close as ever. I’ve accepted the fact that my best friend and I cut ties and people grow apart. It’s life. I love my new job and all of my new coworkers are great and the atmosphere is so positive and I needed it so bad. 

After 8 years of sitting in darkness, I finally reached the light and I just wanted to share this newfound happiness with all of you. 

EDIT: just got back from a concert to an overwhelming positive response! Thank you so much! I’ll be replying to as many comments as I can before bed! I love you guys!

EDIT 2: I’m so happy I’ve given soooo many individuals hope. I’m crying again thanks to you guys. You guys deserve to experience positivity. No ones hopeless as long as you put in the work. This is all I’ve wanted out of life. To spread hope and light. Thank you Reddit from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to do that. 

EDIT 3: So many are asking “how?” Here’s how it worked for ME, it might not be the same for everyone:

Therapy, acceptance and patience

My therapist has been an amazing guide and has completely helped change my mindset and outlook. I took it one day at a time and one day, the change became noticeable. I wasn’t crying anymore. I wasn’t having panic attacks anymore. I found new enjoyable hobbies. I found myself enjoying doing things alone, like video games and creative writing, more and more. And today, it fell into place: I’m happy.

I surrounded myself with non-toxic individuals and cut off the toxic ones. It took a lot of time, 8 years to be exact, but I was patient.

I accepted that shitty things happen in life,  but that doesn’t mean life is shitty. Things happen. People leave. We get hurt. But choosing not to let it overpower us is what makes it easier. Feel the pain but don’t dwell, that’s what my therapist says. Change your routine time to time. Explore new activities. Accept time alone with yourself. When you find who you are alone, it’s such a relieving feeling. "
110,0,"My friend (29m) and I like to skateboard once in a while for exercise/fun. We went to the skatepark last night with my wife. When we got there, two young girls were screaming and running all over the ramps. It's a small place, so the area they were covering was basically all of it. They were laying across all of the ramps and generally just being little girls. This happens a lot and we usually just try to avoid the kids and hope they get the hint that we'd like to use the ramps. For some scenery, I am a clean cut, highly educated, respectful person who avoids confrontation. 

These kids decide to lock on to me and start yelling ""FAIL"" after every thing I do. The ringleader of the two told me that when I am rolling down the ramp she was going to trip me so I smash my head on the concrete. I tell them that isn't nice and they decide that I'm mean now. They keep calling me mean, telling me I'm bad at skateboarding, and yelling out ""FAIL."" To this point, I am being nice and trying to ignore them, they’re just kids, after all. 

The other girl then told me that I had to ride in a specific line that she described, and if I didn't do it, I would die. I didn't do it and she threw a huge handful of sand on me.

I pulled out my phone and acted like I was calling the police. Their tone changed instantly and they started saying ""we're only 9"" and begging. I went to a different part of the park and tried to ignore them but they had latched on to me. I've had enough at this point. They keep yelling ""FAIL"" and I finally said fuck it: 

Me: No, YOU fail. 

Girls: What?

Me: YOU fail. 

Girls: At what?

Me: At being a person. Look how you're acting.

Girls: That's really mean. (visibly upset)

Me: AWWWWWWWW are you going to cry?

Girls: (starts walking toward the parking lot) I'm going to go tell my mommy. 

Me: OHHH NOOOO, not your mommy. 


The girl was almost to tears at this point and I decided to stop talking to them. They didn't bother me again, but I didn't want to end up having to defend myself against angry parents, so we decided to go. I almost feel a bit bad about it, but at the same time, it feels like no one has ever stood up to those bullies before. I can only imagine the nightmare it must be to share the same air with them on a regular basis.

111,0,"I'll start.

When I was 16, I got a voicemail left at 2am from a middle-aged guy the day after I got a new number. He was drunk off his ass, and trying to call his wife who had left him for being a drunk. He cried and explained how he needed her for a good 30 minutes of voicemail.

I listened to it all, then called him, told him I hopes he gets his life together but I wasn't his wife, and he should not call me again.

Cue the next three nights where similar drunk messages were left. They were really revealing and intimate, basically his whole life story.

I called him back, and we started talking. I gave him some advice, called him out on his shit (calling drunk to his wife who wanted him to stop drinking, etc), and he promised to not call back.

For a month, every night it would happen, and he would think he was leaving a voicemail for his wife.

I talk to him two more times to make sure he was ok, then just started ignoring the messages.

But after a month, they suddenly stopped. I got worried something happened to him, but was too busy as a teenager to bother calling him or anything.

Two months after they stopped coming, he called me back to give me a life update.

He took some of the advice I gave him to heart, stopped drinking, and got his shit together. Got a new job, new place to live, new friends.

Then, and only then, he contacted his separated wife and told her he had changed. She was suspicious of him, but he slowly and steadily convinced her.

They got back together, and were planning on having a remarriage ceremony. I spoke to the wife on the phone, and she thanked me for giving her husband a reality check the way I did, and for not reporting him to the police for harassment or something (there were some days he called multiple times at odd times of night).

They called me at their re-wedding, and had me say a few words to the guests over the speaker phone.

Now, a long time later as an adult, I still get regular (once a month) updates of their life. New places they moved to, they bought a dog, he/she got a new job, they had a kid, etc.

We're friends now.

It's the weirdest relationship I have with anyone, and it's not something I get the opportunity to share with others a lot, but it's something I do not wish had not happened to me.

EDIT: Wow! I wasn't expecting such a large response. I'm reading everyone's stories, they're really heartwarming in an ""oddest relationship"" way.

115,0,"I can't really talk about this with anyone since the only people I ever see are my coworkers and it's generally considered taboo to talk about wages with coworkers, but I'm pretty damn stoked about this.

For starters I'm a 31 year old college dropout that lives with my parents, so I'm not exactly where I expected to be in my life at this point but I could be doing a lot worse. Just over 2 years ago I was making minimum wage working fast food jobs, wasn't exactly right in the head and my life kind of fell apart.

Took a seasonal job starting at $10 an hour in spring of 2016, got hired full time and worked there until October last year. Was making $14 an hour when I quit, too much drama and too many conflicting personalities made me decide I could do better. I quit smoking weed so I could get a job through a temp agency, which honestly was really fucking hard for me but it's starting to seem worth it now.

This job I started off at $13 an hour as a temp, it's a CNC operator job and when I get hired in I'm told by coworkers that I'll get a fat raise. Already got a 50 cent raise for going to 3rd shift, now we're starting a new 12 hour shift and I volunteered to work the weekend shift which came with an additional $1 shift premium.

So yeah, life seems to be looking up. This isn't exactly my dream job but it seems to be a perfect stepping stone to get my life back on track.

Edit: This blew up when I sleeping, a lot of people suggested trade schools and it's something I've considered but I really don't want to do blue collar work for the rest of my life. Ideally I'd like to work in the video game industry because it's something I've always dreamed of doing, so if I ever go back to school I'd be leaning towards that. For now I have to focus on paying off debt from my first failed college attempt and I'm getting close, should have it paid off in a couple years and then I'm free to do whatever I want."

119,0,"So a bit of a backstory, between the ages of 15 and 17 I was in a band called Static Pink, we played pop-punk (closest band would probably be 5 Seconds of Summer, Yellowcard or Tonight Alive), and we had a pretty decent following by the time I left - we had fans in Venezuela, the Philippines and more send us fan art and photos of themselves with big banners with our names and faces on them, it was pretty cool.

Skip 4 years and today I get a message from a woman in West Virginia who explains that she's been listening to our music ever since it was released, 5 years ago, and that her daughter is a massive fan and is asking for us to sign a copy of an album for her. I'm 21 years old by now, in university with an entirely different life, as are the rest of the band.

Just thought it was really cool to have someone, 4 years after the band broke up, still listening to the material we put out and still finding the time and effort to message me to explain how much they loved the music.

122,0,"I find this quite funny actually. During the week (I work 8-5 and then hit the gym for around 2 hours) I'm always complaining that I have no time to do fun stuff. I don't mean going out and hanging with friends or whatever. Just generic stuff.

Then during the weekend, like today for instance, I've got absolutely nothing to do, and can't think of any of the aforementioned fun stuff that I can do. I'm just sat here in front of the TV watching movies, scrolling reddit. I sometimes switch on my PS4 and play for about 10 minutes, and then realise that it's not really what I feel like doing.

In some ways, I feel like this is a sign that I'm satisfied with my life. Which makes me feel quite good to be honest. I don't need the weekend to fill some void. I've got a good/satisfying/challenging job, I give it my all at the gym to try and improve myself, and a loving girlfriend and family at home.

I've decided that throughout the next week, whenever I feel like doing something that I'm to tired to do at the time, I'm going to take note of it in my phone, and then revisit the list during the weekend.

Does anybody else ever feel like this? How do you usually fill your *bleh* time."
123,0,"My dad, younger brother, and I went to the mall today and we were just about to leave when my brother saw the Nike store and said, ""Dad, lets go look at the shoes."" So we walked in and drifted to look around. My dad was just kinda walking around, not really expecting much. I walked towards him and noticed him looking at some black, red-laced walking shoes. I told him to try them on and asked him if they were comfortable and nice. He said they were, but then he looked at the price tag and put them back on the shelf. I picked them back up and said, ""let's go."" He then said, ""no stop,"" but I took them to the register anyway and bought them. I turned to him and gave him the bag with the shoes. His eyes got really watery until  some tears fell down his face. He hugged me and said, ""thank you."" 

I know this doesn't seem like a big deal, but things are rough right now for him and my mom. After, 20 years of marriage and trying to fix things, they've given up and decided to called it quits. But I want him to know that even though that's over, I'm still here. He has me, he has my brother, he has people that still love and care for him. I love my dad very much and I'm glad I got to see him lighten up for the first time in weeks.


Edit: I just read every single one of your guys' comments and I cannot thank you guys enough for your kind words. I appreciate every single one of them from the bottom of my heart. Also, was not expecting to be gilded but thank you! 

Edit2: I get the ""RIP inbox"" now. You guys really do have some beautiful stories and thoughtful words. Another thing I hadn't realized was that I wrote my story in a gender-neutral way. For those that were wondering, I am his only daughter out of four. "
124,0,"There is a quite I read today. It said that comparison is the thief of joy. There are few things that are so true.

I turn 25 soon. This year, I've lost 60lbs so far, I've gotten into a decent engineering school, I've become a well organized, and tidy person. And I've started a skincare routine that's really made my skin look a lot better. I've grown in maturity. I've read books (completely finished novels) for the first time in my life without being in school. 

I've made a lot of progress since January 1. But I've never been able to feel good about it. I know the reason why. I get online and all around I see people who are doing much better than me. I see people younger much farther along than me. I see women I know I couldn't attract right now. I see guys my age and younger who look like bodybuilders. I see so many beautiful, smart, amazing people doing incredible things that I want to do. But when I look at myself I only see how far behind I am. 

The thing I'm ashamed to confess is how close I've come to suicide multiple times this year. Each time I was close, it came in the hills of seeing someone online who I felt I couldn't compare to. 

Well no more. I'm taking the next 365 days to focus on me. I'm going to learn, I'm going to track my weight loss, I'm going to talk to a new person each day. I'm going to fake confidence until I'm not faking anymore. 

I'm only going to compare me to me. For the next year, I plan on being almost totally self centered aside from taking care of familial responsibilities. Hopefully I'll be happy come August 29, 2018. I'll see you on this account on that day. "
125,0,"It's weird to describe. I see a lot of posts on the internet of people saying that they don't have friends.

126,0,"Kevin Smith dodged death last night after surviving a massive heart attack. And all I'm seeing this morning are people posting statuses about how much he sucks, how awful Tusk was, what a stoner he is, how he hasn't made a good movie since the 90s. Kevin Smith doesn't make movies for anyone except for his fans, and his fans love him. I wouldn't even call myself a Kevin Smith ""fan"" (I don't listen to any of this podcasts and haven't seen much of his new work). All I know is that Kevin has spent two plus decades honoring his fans, giving his fans what they want, and being an open book about it the whole way. There are a lot of self-indulgent artists out there who deserve to be taken down a peg, but dunking on Kevin Smith has always stuck me as kind of lazy. And to do it less then twelve hours after he almost died isn't just lazy, it's also negative in a way that Kevin Smith never is.

Idk. What are your thoughts about Kevin Smith?"

130,0,"While eating lunch and waiting for my 4pm class yesterday, I started chatting with a guy waiting on his own class. We had over an hour to kill before our classes and decided to walk and chat. 

He's kind of funny and I totally didn't get that we were flirting because I'm almost 22 and have never been in a relationship or close to one. Eventually he asked if he could kiss me and I said sure and it was my first kiss! It was a little awkward at first, but then it just got better and better and I haven't stopped smiling since. He wrapped his arm around me and kept flirting and we kissed a bit more behind a pillar and I walked him to his class because he didn't really know where the building was (at least that's what he said). We held hands and kissed some more outside of the building his class was in and it was just absolutely perfect. The exact way I always imagined my first kiss going, but still a total surprise and in the moment sort of thing. 

Not sure why I'm here really. I guess I just want to tell someone. I'm definitely not about to text my parents, and my girl friends can kind of be man-haters and probably would just say I'm being dumb and I really just want to see that hour as the sort of perfect moment it was. "

Some random old Guy at the side of the Road yelled I should wear the helmet.

He said that's not what he thought season to taste meant and that he would just salt it until you can barely taste the salt.

It kind of just made me realize how much we're learning from each other and that this is something he's trying to do learn for me even though he doesn't like to cook.

He was expecting the McDonalds set up with a posted menu and a speaker box, so when he pulled up and was face to face with a human, he panicked. The first thing he saw on the menu was called a ""not too hot."" His order went something like this...

""Uhh, Uhh, I'll get a not too hot.""

""Do you have kids?""

""What?""

""Sir, that's a kid's hot chocolate. Are you ordering for a kid?""

""No. Uh Uh, can you make it big?""

""How big?""

""Medium.""

And that's the story of how my husband ended up with a hot chocolate when he wanted coffee."
139,0,"I remember the exact amount as it was all of the money I had to my name. 

After a shockingly rapey turn of events last week (I did not know this, but if you're behind on debt to a state University, they can take every last cent from your bank (or in this case, credit union) account, I had no money left at all. They cleared me plum out in one fell swoop in the name of a ""tax levy"". It wasn't a great deal of money to most, perhaps, but to me that $1,440 was months of working hard and scrambling to put a bit away, in my case to get out of a really bad, verbally abusive house/relationship. 

Yes, it's totally my fault. But it was a hugely devestating reality to face as a person without a degree or much income, despite working my butt off. 

Anywho, feeling deeply betrayed by my credit union/college/the state/etc, and also fearful it may happen again, I cashed my last paychecks, feeling that at least the state government couldn't get my money if it was in my wallet. I have every intention of paying them back when I'm able, but I have more pressing bills to pay right now, I'd like to keep eating, etc. 

So, today I did something dumb. I left my wallet in a bathroom stall at Barnes and Noble, where I'd been with a disabled client I work with. 

I didn't realize until we were at Aldi, to use his meager $12 monthly food stamps to get something to make lunch with. Well....

I called B&N, someone had turned it in, and I drove back a nervous wreck to pickup my wallet at the resister, only to find Every. Single. Dollar. still in my wallet. All four hundred and fifty four of them! Ahhhh!

Immense gratitude abounded! I ended up buying my client a bunch of groceries, on me, and cooking him up 10 individually wrapped meals for the week. My tiny way of paying it back. 

Thank you kind, honest soul who turned in my wallet! Thank you kind, honest soul at the resister who left it be. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you universe! 

Feeling very grateful tonight!"

1. No matter what I say, everyone will disagree with me. I could be as in depth as I want, everyone will still disagree with me. This is mainly on gaming subreddits.

2. Every joke is taken. I end up not saying anything because of it. Again, mainly on gaming subreddits.

3. My post and comments will end up getting buried by everything else.

4. Someone else could make a post on a subject and everyone agrees with them, but when I do the exact same thing, all of a sudden, everyone disagrees with me. Ties in with reason 1.

143,0,"This is pretty crazy. Last week, my manager said we had an employee meeting, for today at 3:00. I got there a bit late because I forgot about it, and I went inside. They had me work for a bit, then the general manager led me outside saying “look at these new sun glasses I bought. Try them on outside. 

I put them on as I got outside, and they all surprised me with balloons, crayons (lol), and they all pitched in to buy these glasses (which cost several hundred dollars). 

I appreciate them. That was one of the nicest things anyone’s ever done for me. I feel weird accepting things, but I’m not letting that bother me. 

I just feel different. I love them all. I didn’t know what sub to post this to, and I wanted to write this out. Have a blessed day guys. "
144,0,"My entire family history is marked by poverty. My parents grew up Appalachia poor. My mother was raised in the mountains with no running water and very rarely had electricity. Her family ate only what they could hunt or grow. My father was slightly better off, but his father died young, and he had to start working and hunting and fishing to feed them. While my mother later got a GED, my father had some kind of learning disability that made reading and writing difficult. He never went back for any kind of diploma. To this day, I cherish all of his notes from my childhood. Each one was handwritten in large, all capital letters, carefully spaced and spelled. ""I love you, pumpkin!"" ""You are beautiful!""

I never knew my grandparents. Like many of the people in these areas, they lived hard lives, and died young. 

My parents worked hard to provide a good life for us. We lived almost middle class. We rented for most of my childhood, but we were renting a large house with a yard. We had a dog. Dad hunted to feed us still, but it was supplemental, not a necessity. One of my brothers managed to go to a community college, and then a university. 

I have a good job. Both my husband and I are making 20+ dollars an hour, and in a rural area like this that supplies a good life. The work is physically damaging, however. We are in warehouses, throwing 80, 100, 150lb freight, and we have to be fast. We have to drag and pull and push it, because there's no time for help lifting. My back hurts everyday. My arms, my legs, I'm covered in hard muscle, but everyday is exhausting. I'm 118lbs. I can not do this forever. I have 40 year old co-workers that are about to tap out. They just can't do it anymore. My husband has lost hearing from the loud buzzers in his area, but is heavily discouraged from using ear plugs.

I am back in college now, and after my first two years I will be at a university. I tried when I was 18, but I was living on my own and recovering from a brain injury. I couldn't do it then, but I am doing it now. I am intelligent. I will drag my family out of this hell hole. I know I can do this. I can not fail. I just wanted to tell someone else, anyone else. So, I'm telling you guys. I'm telling all of you that I have this. 

My kid is going to have a good life.

Edit: I woke up today to see my phone lit up with still more amazing responses. I can't believe how nice all of you have been. I am still working my way through the comments, but just know that I am reading them, every one.

145,0,"Started watching Riverdale with my best friend and watching the gay character feels like having to suffer through nails on a chalkboard.

The Gay Best Friend character in media just bugs me so much. "
146,0,"My parents left for Europe like two weeks ago and my dad left me to care for his fish/plants. So I recently got my drivers license and so I finish closing at work and I’m on a high from just driving, I walk the stairs and go to feed to fish.

I turn on the lights. Two fish are just floating dead. My heart just stopped and so I scoop them out and I investigate further and four more fish are dead and another one is swimming around the top of the water. 

So I sent emails to my dad and so he tells me to do a pH test and it’s 6.0 (should be around 7). So here these fish are swimming in acidic water while I’m having the time of my life. 

I called my brother. He just laughed and said he didn’t know what to do but he has a fish tank. 0.o

So long story short I put baking soda into the tank and the fish have perked up or at least the fish that are still alive. I may have over fed the fish or something happened with the last water change that I didn’t do.

What’s a time you got entrusted with something and you completely cocked it up? Also it’s 10:30 at night so I’m dreading to wake up tomorrow and see all the fish dead.


tl;dr dad left me to care for fish and a bunch died. I feel like I’ve died on the inside.


Update 1: I set alarms throughout the night and I’m sleeping upstairs in the lounge room where the aquarium is. The fish that were left have definitely perked up and they’re moving a bit more. There were two I was really concerned about but they seem okay for now. Next step is just to turn the pump back on later today and feed them not as often. Thanks for all your help guys! Whether it be joking around or just talking I appreciate it :) Nearly 1am and I woke up sweating so I’m gonna be super tiered later but I’d rather be tired knowing I’ve done everything I can.

Update 2: Woke up and found one dead, he looked like he was going to before I went to bed. I then prepped the water change and I went to church. Rushed back after it was over and found 2 more dead. BUT! There’s hope. I changed the water, it was filthy and the filters were filthier. They’re now in a nice pH level and in clean water. I’ve got the pump on giving them some air (I think that’s what it does) and they definitely look better. One however looks a bit funny. Will tell my sister to look over it while I leave for work. Total body count is 11 I think. 4 remain. I’ve already told my dad I’ll replace the ones he wants and I’ll give him some extra money to splurge on a more expensive fish if he wants. I’m super tired but feeling better. Thanks everyone for hanging around and sharing stories/advice! God bless!

147,0,"2 weeks ago I went to LA and we parked our car and crushed a 6 pack on the beach in Venice and saw all the craziness go down there, then got in an uber and told the guy to take us to somewhere with a bunch of women. The driver, an Italian guy in his 40's, starts recounting how much ass he used to pull (his words) in West Hollywood and how we should go to West Hollywood and don't worry that it's going to be mostly gay people, they don't bite, and that so many women go out there. We decided to go for it and he advised us to go to the Abby.

We went and I immediately noticed the go-go dancers, a bunch of lean, muscular, thong clad men dancing on platforms. I've been to numerous bars with scantily clad female go-go dancers and never thought anything of it, but I bet that for some women that can be terribly intimidating or indicating of an objectifying environment, was an interesting thought. My buddy and I grabbed drinks and surveyed the scene, there were indeed some women and A LOT of well groomed, well dressed, guys walking around, if I hadn't known it was a gay bar I would have thought ""wow there's a lot of competition here."" I also noticed a lot of people returning my gaze looking around.

Then my friend went to the bathroom, leaving me alone. It was like a feeding frenzy. Guys were COMPETING for the opportunity to buy me a drink, hitting me with pick up lines, walking up like ""I love you."", having conversations that went like this ""hi"" ""hi"" ""where you from?"" ""san diego"" ""oh take my number, if you need a place to crash just hit me up."" it was NUTS.

I tried to talk all suitors out of buying me a drink because I knew what they were after and they wouldn't be happy with the result as I was straight and came there to meet women, that deterred 0%. I finally asked one of these guys why he wanted to buy me a drink and he said ""because I can"" so I said ""OK"" so he asked me what I was drinking and I said anything, he said no what are you drinking so I said whiskey soda, he said what kind of whiskey and I said ""well"" to which he said ""please"" and ordered Makers Mark. 

So then I'm talking to these guys and other guys keep coming up trying to talk to me and the guys I was talking to got all snoody like ""Don't talk to those losers."" One such guy would not go away or stop being too forward, and not in a fun way, so I instinctively told him that my friend, who had come back and was also down to jump on the free drinks train for a while, was my husband (which I have had multiple girls do to me with people who were obviously just friends of theirs at times when I've not taken a hint) so then this dude starts sheepishly grabbing at my ass when he perceived my friend as not looking. 

Wound up making it out in one piece and going to some after hours spot with these Russian girls we met there. (which is it's own crazy story, I cannot believe LA has legit establishments that you can smoke weed and do cocaine openly INSIDE at). Due to the novelty it was a good, funny experience, but I totally get why women go to gay bars now. I could see having a hoard of thirsty dudes trying to bang you as fast as they possibly can getting old pretty fast.

**Edit: Regrettably a good amount of the comments on this post are a fiery-worded debate about the morality of straight people going to gay bars. I even got sucked into it there for a bit. I'd like to remind everyone that this is /r/casualconversation. I'd like to acknowledge the point of view of these gay people, I was unaware that some (and it sounds like many) gay people do not appreciate straight people coming to gay bars. I lived in a small town in the Pacific NW for a year that I could definitely see 2 guys making out or dancing at a bar leading to an otherwise unprovoked physical altercation, this was in a very blue state, I'm sure there are places like this in almost all states. I understand the overwhelmingly strong desire to have places where you can let loose like any person wants to and feel safe doing so.**

**I may strongly dislike being told it is morally wrong of me to go to a place due to my sexuality (this is actually my first experience with that) but I have no interest in debating my righteousness in going to a gay bar, if it wasn't clear from my post, this is not my routine and there is no threat of this becoming my routine. I learned something today and it sounds like a lot of other redditors who are getting fired up were unaware of this too. Let's play nice. It was a funny night out and stuff that happened to me happens to women at bars all the time, that's all I meant by the post.**"

I was overweight/obese for as long as I can remember. I was teased as far back as 1st grade and I remember feeling ashamed of shopping in the husky section for clothes (which, now that I think about it, is a shitty name to subject fat kids to). I always tried fad diets but never lost more than 5lbs. per attempt.

Age 15, I was 215lbs, the highest I've been, and considered obese at my height. I had to train for 1 year for my black belt which involved a shitload of cardio. I had just gotten into reddit and found out about /r/keto and /r/ketorecipes. I was desperate so I tried it, and I wound up coming down to 165 in that year. That was still overweight but I was able to keep up with all the other trainees.

For the next 3 years I periodically tried more keto but couldn't find the motivation to stick with it now that I wasn't training for my black belt. So I stayed overweight. This semester, I dragged a friend, also looking to lose weight, into it with me and I guess that's all the motivation we needed. We've run a mile and biked 3-4, 3x a week for the past 2 months and stuck fast to the diet. Coincidentally, he's also lost 25lbs and feels amazing.

Today we went to the gym, I weighed myself, and I turned out to be 145, the exact weight where overweight stops and healthy starts according to BMI for my height. Like I said, I have no recollection of this ever happening in my life. This is a new, exciting thing for me. I still have some fat to burn off but just the  idea of being healthy for once is amazing.

The funniest thing about all this, for me, is that I'm short and have barely grown at all since my early teens. And I was already overweight back then. So I'm pretty sure I weigh less now than I did at age 12.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just excited. I never would have thought this would be possible, but here I am. Thanks for reading, if you have indeed read this all. If anybody is trying to lose weight, please remember that it's hard but definitely possible. And if anybody needs help, motivation, or advice with their own weight loss, please feel free to ask via comment or PM. Of course, there's /r/keto and /r/ketorecipes as well."
153,0,"There is this dad at my daughter’s school whom I’ve met several times.

The first time we met, we introduced ourselves and since then we've talked with each other several times.

The problem is that I never remembered his name, yet he remembered mine.

He always verbalized my name every time we met, but unfortunately I could not do the same so I got stuck with the generic “Man”.

Any time we met, I said: “What’s going on, Man? How are you? Good to see you.”

At one point it became awkward so I decided to ask his name, but I didn't want to say, “Sorry, I forgot your name” because that would have implied that I never knew it all along, so I decided to go with a different approach.

The next time I talked with him at my daughter’s school, midway through I looked at him and said:

“You know, my wife and I have been discussing about how to pronounce your name properly. We just don’t seem to agree and I don’t like to mispronounce anybody’s name. Can you pronounce it for me exactly as your mom pronounces your name?”

The guy looks at me with eyes wide open and says:

“Joe”

It's probably better to just say that you forgot."
154,0,"I have always been an outgoing person but over the years I noticed that I was being influenced by my surroundings and I was starting to become an antisocial homebody. Nowadays people find any possible excuse to stay inside and do nothing. I would even offer to pay for my friends/significant other and their things and yet everyone around me seem to be into the “couch potato lifestyle “, even my now fiancé. So today I took the courage and finally purchased a ticket for a concert I’ve been looking forward to go and I’m going all by myself and I feel great.

Don’t let the fear of doing an activity by yourself  stop you from doing those things and enjoying life :)

__________________________________________________________

I am an atheist *(well I am not really sure yet but I am probably an agnostic atheist)* and I can fully understand the mentality behind religion

I am sort of in a love-hate relationship with religion

I can understand its purposes, mostly in terms of giving hope to people or at least it helps them to make sense of the world around them, especially to those who are unfortunate.

It may a false sense of hope and belief but it makes sense to them *(like example, a soldier prays to God, that slight sense of hope may affect his psychosomatic response in battle and may actually increase his chance of making it out alive)*

I will admit that I do not like it when religion takes over, namely the extremist kind like for example, fundamentalists, those who prefer prayer over modern medicine, those who wish to spread their beliefs by force, when religion is mixed with the legal system, when people judge others based on their beliefs and so on.

However .....

I am also **VERY, VERY** annoyed when atheists love to bully those who are religious, namely because of the increased interest in science and logical thought.

I am supporter of science and I fully acknowledge its purposes but I do not want to use my knowledge of science so far *(because even science goes through changes as times goes on)* to humiliate those who are ignorant *(as in, the uneducated)*

That is why I do not like the science icons that are on the media like Bill Nye, Neil Degrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins.

I admire their intent to spread science and logical reasoning but I absolutely despise how they make religious people act like idiots *(and I mean religious people in general, not to those who are fundamentalists)*

*(and I mean especially Richard Dawkins. He is known as one of the four horsemen of Neo-Atheism for a reason)*"
161,0,"I just wanted to share some of the sillier and more wonderful things about my dog because I won't get many opportunities to discuss Frodo very often any more. 

He was a little Maltese-poodle (more poodle). He hated water. I don't think he ever entered water on purpose. However, he was attached (to a disturbing extent) to my mom. When she would kayak out onto the lake, Frodo would run whining out onto the dock to be that tiny bit closer. The only time he ever got close to entering the water by choice was then she brought her kayak closer and he decided that jumping from from the dock to her kayak was a great idea. That didn't work out. Frodo was not a dog built for water.

He did, however, love snow. My mom sewed him a lovely little snow suit, including pants and all. Looked a bit like a dog space suit. Anyhow, even if there was only a few centimeters of snow he would drop his from legs, put the side of his face against the ground, and run full speed with his back legs so his face would plough snow. He would also jump into excessively deep snow and immediately get disoriented and go in the wrong direction. Even when hiking in the hottest months in the North Cascades, he would without fail always find that little bit of snow leftover in the shade under a tree to do this face running thing. 

My favourite memory comes from when he was only a year in my family, and a family friend sent us a ""Duckworth."" Bloody brilliant toys, at least, if you asked Frodo they were. I've never seen him do this with any other toy: he took the duck in his mouth, laid on his back, legs splayed, and laid motionless for probably fifteen minutes straight growling at the duck wedged in his mouth.

He also laid on top of the couch back like a cat, could jump to any height if a hamburger was involved, did burnouts on the linoleum (while squealing quite loudly), and would stick his nose as far down the car air vent as possible when we were on road trips. 

What a wacky dog. Share your happy memories. Pets are so precious, and they build so many lovely feelings over the years. This is about the happy memories :) 

**Edit:** I have been informed that Frodo is now making heaven a magical and happy place with his weirdness. The last I saw of him was through facetime with his head nestled on my dad's lap, and when I said his name his ears perked up. I sadly couldn't be with him but as mentioned, this is about the happy memories. What a lovely little creature. Read on if you want some funny stories about pets, I'm not the only one here sharing some laughs. 

**Edit 2:** I'm very happy that this post in dedication to the happiness our little friends bring us has managed to break 100 upvotes. Love for everyone :) 

**Edit 3: [Here's a photo of my little friend while hiking in the subalpine of the North Cascades.](https://i.imgur.com/YfUqcZi.jpg)** My mother designed and sewed him that snow suit. The picture sums up his essence: a reborn Arctic explorer."

A few months ago we found each other on FB. We discovered that all these years later, and mulitiple moves, we only live a few hours apart.

Today, 45 years later, we are meeting again.

This is going to be so cool! I'm waiting for him now and I can't wait!

UPDATE:  It went so beautifully! Giving him a hug, we fit together perfectly,just like old times!  Just being with him was so perfect, so calming (he's always was very mellow). We went to dinner, we visited, he spent the night...but no, not together haha.  Today we went had breakfast, went for a drive.

To answer, yes we are both single. It was not a date, it was a meeting of old used-to-be lovers. We were each others ""first"".

Will we see each other again...yes, we are planning on it!  You never know!  As my daughter said: ""Wouldn't it be cool if your first love was to be your last love also?"""

180,0,"** Major spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the movie yet***

So today I went to go see Black Panther with my sister. I haven't seen her in a year. She doesn't really like action films because she feels they are mostly ""plot less"" and ""Nothing but guns shooting"", but she actually enjoyed this one.

Anyway!

While watching the movie I totally understood how Erik, Black Panther's cousin felt. I and my sister are first generation African Americans. I have always felt that I was too African for Black Americans. I talk ""like white people"" or ""snobs"". To them I eat strange food and talk funny... But to Africans I am too ""American"". They also think I talk funny and eat strange foods, lol. 

When I told my sister this she completely understood. It was liberating. Poor Erik felt trapped between two worlds. It was nice watching a movie that was able to truly understands us... It was so wonderful to finally see Africans as powerful and not victims. So long have people shown us on TV as nothing but hut dwellers and ignorant fools who need the charity of other nations to move forward.

Another thing that totally amazed me was how the five tribes were all designed after major African tribes from all over the continent. It was so beautiful.

I cried a little bit. Because deep down I knew that if there was less corruption in Africa that we would be seen as equals.

182,0,"Since joining reddit, I [18F] have learned many things. 
Humans are very complex. More complex than I always believed *everyone else* to be. 
I have learned that basic human emotions aren’t always basic. One emotion can carry a vast amount of feelings. 
The word “weird” can have a negative and/or positive connotation. For me: weird means normal.   Humans are weird. That involves me, you, him, her, she, SO, OP, them, and it.
Humans are lonely.
Humans are also very curious.
Humans are nosy 
And also very sexual
I have also found, that some of the most genuine interactions have been over this exact platform. 
I have learned, how human bodies work, how many people have experienced the same things I have, or wondered the same things as me. 
It has made me value this universal sacred self.
I also now know, I’m not the wisest person in the world, nor am I the most ignorant.
It has taught me the importance of finding each other’s sameness, and stop turning shoulders for their differences.
I often doubt the compassion of others, and their ability to help. But I’ve learned there is no reason to.
Also, what we carry internally, is much more important than what is beyond. 
Thank you Reddit 
Have a cool day.

I fully expected her to say no, But I tried to be confident and just went for it and she actually said yes!!

I chose to split my 300 hours into 2 places and do 150 each, one at a rehab office and the other at a gym for college level athletes. So the paper was on my experience at these 2 places, answered questions that needed to be answered, put in a bunch of charts/tables that were needed.

I went to the local Community College and got an Associates Degree in Networking, and started working in the IT field while I was still in college, going from $10 an hour, to $12, to $14.40, $16.67, $18.81 and now i'm over $21 an hour and it blows my mind that I can consider myself ""Middle class"".

I didn't actually have a physical ring either, so I showed her a picture of what I had picked out. It was a good thing too because, while she liked the ring, she had already had a few ideas of her own, so now we're both looking at rings together. I'm so elated right now.

Everyday she comes back from school and she immediately jumps on games like R6S, Overwatch and Fortnite. The only time when our family would get together is during dinner. My sister, Sarah, would finish hers quickly so she could jump straight back to video games.

We would eat in the living room where the PS4 is located, so we'd watch her play while eating and just talk. Sometimes we would help her by pointing out to things like ""Sarah, there's somebody inside the building on the left."" and she'll respond ""Got it.""

She's surprisingly a very good gamer. Last time I checked she's now in Diamond in OW while I'm stuck in Gold but I don't really play much so I don't mind. She'd rage a lot too and my mom would worry about her but she never does bad in school, her grades didn't slip, her co-curricular activities are in check so I guess she let it slide.

211,0,"So ever since the first class, I saw this cute girl and I've been wanting to talk to her. I never talked to her until today, during our final class together. 


I sat next to her and realised I forgot to bring my pencil case (genuinely) so I thought it was a good conversation starter to ask if I could borrow a pen from her. We ended up talking and sharing a few laughs, so at the end of the class, I said ""fuck it"", I'm gonna ask her out.


Didn't work out. I fucked up pretty badly. I spoke faster than Eminem on Rap God and had no idea what I was saying at one point. I kind of just spilled the words out ""Thanks for the pen, how about I take you out to lunch t-"" and I didn't even finish my sentence and she gave me an embarrassed laugh, shook her head, and said ""No""


I kind of just laughed it off after class and shook my head, thinking ""What was I doing?! That was a terrible segue into asking her out"" 


I don't regret it though, I'm usually introverted and self-conscious about talking to girls, so I'm glad I didn't pass up the opportunity to ask her out. I think it would have been worse if I was left with the regret of not trying. 


I hope this story doesn't discourage you!

She even told me the other day she was with her friend and he had ranted to her about how she couldn't understand it, but her friend was British so she just assumed it was an American thing. Once she had told me all of this I was sure what the cause was, so I opened up her MacBook and went on chrome. Sure enough she had one extension installed and it was the clouds to butts one.

I've noticed recently that I've been thinking about my future, managing finances, even shopping for new clothes (still online, but it's a start). 

Yesterday I started to listen to music again; music I used to listen to and sing along with, I listened to and sang along with last night!

I have also noticed that I can articulate my thoughts better and I even had a normal dream Friday night. My cats are cuter, days are nicer (though I'm still locked inside). Everything just has a brighter sheen to it.

It's not great yet, but I hope it continues. I've needed to move for my new job for months but haven't had the will. I feel like I might be ready to make a change that I've wanted to make for years. I don't know how this is happening, but it is!

I wanted to correct her but she uses that word with everyone (!). Too many people...fetish. Too much icing on a cupcake...fetish.  The list goes on.

She began talking about something about long lines is added to her fetish list. I sighed and said, Mom I think you're looking for the word pet peeve. The look on her face was something else. Then she said, Have I been using the wrong word?! I then had to explain some things to her. We're good now!"

I met this girl a couple of weeks ago at a concert, had a really good talk and asked for her number. I texted her the very next day that I'd like to meet her again if she's up for it, just for a casual conversation any time she's free, and we actually met again last night. We went to a bar at 7pm, and after a couple of glasses of wine and a really good talk we realized the time was already 3am!

Just wanted to share this with someone. What's the best present you have ever received? :)

*******************************************************************************
_Update:_ As man yof you have requested, here's my update. So I met her the week after I made this post. I prepared myself mentally to pop the question to her when we get to somewhere chill (like a café or something). Problem was though that I never got the chance to talk to her in private because we had another friend who always hung out with us. So I didn't feel comfortable to seperate him from us for a minute or two. I tried to but just ended up making things a tiny bit awkward so I stopped.

When I finally had the chance to ask her out after class I bitched out. Plain and simple. All day I focused on that one thing and during the whole day I felt comfortable asking her out but when I finally got the chance to do so something held me back.

I was pissed at myself but then said to myself ""It's not like it's the last time I'm gonna see her."" 


Oh boy. I was so wrong.


Turns out that after that day she just didn't want to come to uni anymore. Like AT ALL.
I can't really blame her, I knew that she had to drive two hours everyday to get to uni and back. She also didn't enjoy uni. Picked the wrong major I guess.

Damn. Seems like I blew my only chance, didn't I?


Luckily, I didn't.


I managed gather our small group of friends to go out to dinner and some ice skating.
During ice skating, when we were skating alongside, I then asked her out. She was confused at first, thinking that I was joking. I then told her that I was serious, told her how I feel about her, complimented her, etc.

After that we skated silently alongside together for a few seconds, after which she gave me her answer.


She said no.

She said that it was cute of me that I told her and that she appreciates my feelings for her but she just wasn't really interested in me and generally not ready for a relationship yet.

I felt stupid. I was proud of myself but still felt stupid. After her reply I tried to act cool and spat out the basic stuff like: ""oh yeah, it's cool"" ""nah, it's all right."" ""I feel you."" but I died inside.

I guess she noticed that her answer saddened me. She stopped me and gave me a hug, told me that she appreciates me and that I'm a good friend to her though.

We ended our ice skating session and we went home.


We are still friends and we still chat occasionally, so nothing changed about our friendship.


Sorry for the late reply but I just wasn't able to meet up with her again until recently."

This made her really mad and she started ranting about how she could say it, and my stepfather started ranting about how this was his house and he could say whatever.

He left the dinner table, mom also did the same.

So I am now sitting alone eating taco's by myself.

All this because I told them not to use the ""N"" word around me.

So I let it play. I let it play through the whole song. Throughout the song I obviously had to sing along. It's an amazing song. Occasionally I heard some giggling and the scattered ""Shhhh"" letting me know there was indeed human life on the other end of the phone.

This August I was let go from the company along with the rest of my fellow interns. 


I looked for a job immediately. The issue was most companies wanted someone who already had a degree. For three weeks I heard nothing. I needed my resume to stand out somehow. I had good experience but the lack of a degree was hurting me. ""Let's be funny,"" I thought. So on the very last line of my resume, I added ""Can skillfully perform a wide array of different animal noises."" Friends and family tried to advise me against it but I listened to my gut. 

I got a call. At the end my my interview my interviewer says, ""So what about these animal noises?"" I told her I do a great monkey, cat, dog, and various birds. She asked if I could do a duck because one of her coworkers did a duck really well. Anyway, she said my noises were the only reason she called me in. As we spoke though, she started to realize that I actually knew what I was doing and talking about and ended up feeling really good about me. A few days later I got a call.

I am seeing Ready Player One and am the only one in the movie theater. This may become my new thing. :)

Edit: Oh my gosh this blew up unexpectedly! Ready Player One was absolutely awesome and such a nostalgia trip! Eileen said that aside from Deadpool and Star Wars, this has been one of her favorite movies as of late. I want to be like her when I grow up.

Thank you for your kind words and encouragement everyone! It was awesome doing a solo movie experience and I am searching for my next adventure!

Second edit: Okay so my scatterbrained self forgot to say to the newcomers to the thread that Eileen is mentioned in the first response to the first comment. She is a wonderful sweet woman who saw RP1 when her husband wouldn't see it with her. She and I sat close to each other and it really helped me come out of my shell more and not be so anxious about being alone. We need more Eileens on the world."

253,0,"For the last 10 or 15 years I had always wanted to see someone using a monocle in real life.   
I don't remember where this desire originally came from but I would have been in high school at the time.    
It couldn't be a part of a costume, or someone 'ironically' using one to be trendy; it had to be an old man or woman going about their daily life with a genuine use of a monocle.    

Usually I don't do my grocery shopping until late in the evening. I'm not particularly fond of crowded places and there's far fewer people doing a shop at 8 or 9pm.   
I have a lot to get done this evening, so I had to get it out of the way earlier in the day. I figured 2:30 in the afternoon would be perfect; well after lunchtime and just before the supermarket goes apeshit with screaming kids having just been picked up from school. 

I zipped around and grabbed everything on my list and made my way to the checkout where I sidled up behind a sweet old guy pushing 90 years old and started unloading my basket... 

And then it happened. 

The cashier printed the guy's receipt and handed it to him.  
It fluttered in his unsteady hands as he squinted at it for a few moments and then reached into his fleece jacket and pulled out what I thought was just a magnifying glass. 

He lodged it in his brow and started going over his receipt.   

It didn't even register with me at first but then I double-taked when I realised what was going on.   
Such a beautiful moment that I'd been on the lookout for for over a decade. 

I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and I'd be completely fine with it.

254,0,"I seriously had some *major* cravings lastnight, from Chinese food to eventually landing on pizza. I was in my room, already in the process of ordering pizza on my phone... and then just decided not to.

It was a really weird feeling, to be honest. I didn't decide ""Actually it doesn't sound *that* good after all"". I was *intensely* craving it, to the point I felt like I could actually picture how it *tastes* in my mind. And I remember thinking ""Well, if you can remember how it *tastes*, that's probably a super bad sign and I've clearly not gone long enough since eating it"".

So, I couldn't find anything at home I felt like eating, so I literally just forced myself to go to bed, to avoid eating out.

It's a small, stupid thing, but I'm honestly kind of proud of myself. I've never been able to resist food cravings like that, so waking up this morning, I felt like I already had a minor ""win"" under my belt, which is kind of a nice feeling.

Now, I just need to keep this up for the rest of the year, and maybe I'll be at a weight I'm happy with..."

260,0,"I know a lot of people will be like ""it's just words, who cares"" but as someone who's suffered from severe OCD for 20 years, 2/3 of my life, it really kind of bothers me. 

I feel like there's more misconceptions about OCD than most other mental illnesses.  People think it's a quirk or a personality trait.  People think being a bit anal retentive about something is being ""a little OCD"", or that liking things neat or being able to match things is OCD.

The reality is much worse.  It's intrusive thoughts that will not get out of your head plaguing you all day every day.  It's doing absolutely crazy stuff that makes no sense to try to feel safe and make the thoughts go away.

I do absolutely absurd stuff in my daily life.  Most my compulsions revolve around body movements so I'm constantly tapping my fingers, rolling my eyes, bending my knees, spreading my toes, all sorts of wacky things and I can't stop.  I get so nervous in public because I worry I look like a lunatic and that people are staring at me.  Then I obsess over that.  I get intrusive thoughts about my family dying, nuclear war coming, my boyfriend leaving me, and they won't ever get out of my head.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.

I wish people understood it more and were more open to being educated on it.  Someone in a subreddit I frequent mentioned someone being ""a little OCD"" and when I said ""hey, as someone with OCD that's not right at all"" I got downvoted.  I guess it's hard for most people to understand and relate to so they don't care.

263,0,"So my girlfriend is on night shift and there was a break in that stole her keys and documents with our home address. It's 2:37 am in Melbourne and I'm sitting in the hallway with a bat waiting for someone to rock up. I'm just here to stay awake until morning. 

EDIT:

So my partner is home, and she's off shift and the locksmith has come and gone. I'm going to try and get some sleep. Thank you all for keeping me company!

EDIT 2:

Its now 8am, we're still alive and didn't hear anything. What we reckon happened is that my gf and her work partner got back to their branch while the place was being robbed and scared them off, so they only got her keys. We also reckon that the robbers were some actual scrotes because they left big handprints and didn't bother picking up any actual money leaving around or taking the cat. Likely, they couldn't be bothered making the walking to the house. I'm still in bed but I'm gonna check my setup but I doubt I'm going to find anything. 

EDIT 3:

Alright, the whole thing has been resolved, so I can give you the whole story. I was being intentionally vague for security. My GF is a paramedic and was working night shift when there was a break in at her branch. They arrived when the perp was still there so they called the local police who stormed and cleared the building. When she realized that the keys and documents were missing, a unit was sent to the house and she called me to let me know. Her car (not cat) was fine and not stolen, but was towed and the ambulance insurance is handling that. The police (bless their hearts) called around for a locksmith while my gf organized insurance and a statement. I was meanwhile setting up noisemakers and wedging shut doors to prevent entry. She came home early and the locksmith had everything replaced by 4am. We got some sleep and this morning, the crime lab looked at the crime scene and car, and there were some good boot impressions and finger prints. Theres a halfway house nearby and so the police got an ID, served an arrest warrant and found the guy (just the one) with a bunch of stolen stuff from the branch. No keys unfortunately. Huge shout-out to all you for keeping me company for the couple of hours I was sitting in my hall alone, and to the Police for getting the fucker so quickly. It's a shame we didn't get the keys for the peace of mind, but everything would have to be rekeyed anyway, so it's six of one half dozen of the other.

I wasn’t a great student in high school. I was lazy and unmotivated and had like a 2.5 GPA. I thought I would never go anywhere in life and I was never thought of as “smart.” Well now I’m in college and for the first time since like middle school, I have a 4.0. I finally decided to get my shit together and actually try my best. Last week in my trig class, we had our second test of the semester and I got 100%. Not because the test was easy, I actually struggled a lot with that chapter and was very lost and confused but I worked my ass off and studied for weeks leading up to the test and managed to actually get 100%. The week before, I got 100% on my philosophy test, and then before that a 100% on my geography test (my teacher told me I got the highest grade in the class). It feels so awesome to see your hard work pay off. It’s a very liberating feeling when you finally realize that you are in charge of your own success and education and that if you put in the hard work, you will see great results. I’m not lazy anymore like I used to be in high school and I don’t procrastinate anymore, I’ve really transformed my work ethic and study habits and it feels fucking awesome. That is all, thank you strangers for reading this :)

After an hour of opening presents everyone got a present but me; I am not well liked in the family. I did not care much as I had come to expect such things.

As the kids were playing with their new toys and gadgets I sat by myself in the kitchen enjoying what was left of the breakfast feast. I was munching on some bacon when my 5 year old niece came running into the room. She was holding her new doll in her hand and laughing a storm. She sees me in the kitchen by myself and asks me what I got for Christmas. I casually answer that  did not receive much but that it was okay. Ever the curious little nugget, she asks if I am sad. I respond with the classic ""no"". She runs off without saying a word.

A minute had not passed before she comes running back with her favorite toy, a little white plush lamb, who she calls Benedict. She applies the breaks and walks towards me and simply hands Benedict to me. ""For you! Merry Christmas!"" She has had this little lamb since she was a few days old, she could not be separated from it for anything. I'll be sure to keep the little lamb close by for when the sentiment has run its course and she wants Benedict back lol"

274,0,"I have pretty severe OCD.

It makes my body hurt and makes me really self conscious in public because it's probably quite noticeable.

I'm on a new medication that's supposed to help with my OCD.  It hasn't helped much yet, but I think it's made me more aware of my compulsions.  

A couple hours ago I was lying in bed cuddling with my cats and watching Game Grumps and told myself ""Just stop.  Just for a minute.  Try to resist it.""  I somehow managed to.  It made me anxious and uncomfortable but I did it.  I looked at the clock and bet myself I couldn't do it for five whole minutes.  I somehow did.  Five minutes became ten.  It was so difficult but I managed to resist flexing my muscles and squeezing my joints.  Finally after exactly fifteen minutes I couldn't take it anymore and had to start acting on my strong urges to do all these weird things.

I know it seems really bizarre and probably difficult to comprehend for a lot of people but I'm kind of proud of myself for it.  It's the first time I've been able to go more than a few minutes without acting on my compulsions since I was a child.  Maybe there's hope for me yet.

Oh my god, it was awesome. So last night was our first date. We've always been slightly awkward around each other, and this was to be the night where we would just let it out.

I picked her up at her house and we hit the road. The Guardians of the Galaxy mix CD was put in. We bought some candy, snuck it into the theater (Oh no, a cop's probably gonna read this), and watched Interstellar. Lemme say this: In my opinion, it is literally the best movie ever made. I seriously cried four times. 

Anyways, we left the theater in absolute awe, and we drove down to the local diner to eat. It was the only place around that's open that late, and we like the food and have some good memories there, so it was fantastic as far as a place goes. The whole time we were eating we were talking, laughing, having a wonderful time. My heart was beating at about three thousand miles an hour.

We finished up and made the frigid walk to the car. I opened up the seat between us so that there was nothing blocking the way. The car was cold, we were cold, so we hugged. It started off as a ""joke"" hug, but then we just held on. We eventually broke up the hug and I started driving her back to her place. She held my hand as I was driving, and even though we were joking around the whole time we could feel the tension building with every song that ran through. 

Eventually we made it to her house. I put the car in park and looked over at her. She was looking at me. We unbuckled and held each other again. We stopped to gather her things from around the car. I shifted so I was facing her more. ""Go All The Way"" started playing on the CD. She was looking up at me with her freaking gorgeous eyes piercing through me. I put my arm around her, held her hand, and went for it. 

OH. MY. GOD. We were kissing. It was the most incredible thing I've experienced. Neither of us knew what we were doing, but none of our inexperience made it any less amazing. Of every moment from the date, this is the one I remember in the most exquisite detail. The blue light of the dash, her smell, the softness of her lips, the sound of the music. It was all there, it was all incredible.

We broke it off eventually, hugged it out, and she got out of the car and walked back to her house. I listened to ""Spirit in the Sky"" on the way back, walked into my house, said hi to my mom, and fell asleep after texting her goodnight. Would I have traded anything for that night? Not a chance.

278,0,"The admin in our department has a candy dish which she keeps at her desk.  She usually has a rotation of different kinds of candy that she refills it with so we get a good variety.  This candy dish is much appreciated by the staff and gets raided constantly.

This week, however, the grab bag of candy she's been using to fill the dish somehow has some ring pops in it.  [Here's](https://www.candywarehouse.com/assets/item/large/ring-pop-on-hand.jpg) a picture if you're not familiar with it.  It's basically a giant Jolly Rancher on a ""base"" with a little loop so you can stick in on your finger.  I remember disliking this these as a kid and avoided them.  Apparently the rest of the staff feels the same way because no one else grabbed them either.

So they've been sitting in the candy dish for at least a week, taking up space that could better be used for other candy.  Our admin's refilled the dish several times, but the ring pops remain.  So it's clear to me they're just going to sit in there until someone eats them.  On the way back to my desk about 10 minutes ago, I decided to take one for the team and grab one.

They're even worse than I remember.  The flavor wasn't *awful*; something called ""blue raspberry"", but the platform is what makes them truly terrible.  Unlike a regular lollipop with a regular stick, you can suck on it with your lips since that's as far as the actual candy portion you can actually get into your mouth.  So not only does that make it take longer to consume, but in inhibits the enjoyment of what little flavor it possesses.  Worse, the base & ring parts look like a damn pacifier, and because you can only hold it in with your lips you've got to suck on it like you're nursing from a bottle in order to keep the juices from escaping your mouth.  It's terrible.

So here I am, a 38 year old man in a professional position sucking on a damn nuk like I'm an infant just trying to consume this damn stupid candy so it stops taking up space in the candy dish.

I hope everyone else in the department appreciates my sacrifice.

After that I was always wary with how my personality came off to people I met, so I never really tried to initiate any relationship with anyone. 

Flash forward to the present, in one of my university lectures, I sit around all guys. There's this one guy I sit fairly close to who — ever since the first day of class — I thought was very attractive. I thought I could never build up the courage to talk to him, or anyone in my class at all. 

Well, I took the chance and talked to him and his friends!!!

Yesterday, I went to class a little early and sat on my usual spot. The guy beside me was giving a mint to his friend and then asked if I wanted one. I don't know what came over me but I just asked them how they were doing with the chapter we were on, we talked about that for a bit. Then somehow the conversation shifted away from that. They asked me if I was from the city, I got to know their background a little bit, we introduced each other and shook hands. They were really nice and we talked until the prof started the lecture! AND GUYS, I WASN'T AWKWARD AT ALL!!! The energy and vibes just felt spot on.
 
A part of me knew that my social skills weren't THAT bad but my friends comment still affected me and has caused me to overthink in social interactions many times. I haven't REALLY talked to anyone in any of my classes like I did yesterday. Just shows what can change once you show initiative and interest :).

Eventually we're going to reach a point where we're watching Thor 17: spider man and barnacle boy go to outback steakhouse. I am just getting ready for the next phase of movies, what do you think of all these new releases"

287,0,"Most career opportunities start off with a brief phone call to see if you're the right fit. I've done so many of those, that I always wondered if I was doing something wrong in my spheal. I never would get a call back. A week later, they would express their feelings that they decided to peruse other candidates at this current time. In fact, I've been so used to rejection that I went in the mindset that I would be rejected anyways. Eventually it became why even apply. 

I graduated last year and will make roughly two years I've been out of college. It's been a long, tedious process. I've been heartbroken, laptop gave way, wasted money, had to refuse extra hours at work to accommodate phone interviews, and then suffer by paying rent, but then eating ramen, and not to mention all the nights of forgoing celebrating with friends and family, in lieu of busting out one more job application, thinking hopefully this is the one, the lucky one that might grant me a call back.. 

I cannot tell you how much I'm in awe that someone could make the choice to see the potential in me. It's mellowing and mind blowing to say the least. The job search has been grueling and gruesome, to say the least.

I've thought of giving up, way too many times, way more then I can count, and this one means the world to me. Even if this isn't the career opportunity I have spent all this time looking for, just having the opportunity to view and see in person an actual company, an actual recruiter, I'm so touched and proud.

Wish me luck. I didn't know where else to post this, because I didn't want to jinx it, knock on wood, but this is it. 

If I don't get this, I just might work up the retail ladder. This is my last shot...."

289,0,"I was in my living room at around 11 PM, and I heard a rustling and clattering on the back porch. I peeked out the window and saw a raccoon playing with some cat toys we'd left out. So I went up to the sliding glass door and laid on my stomach, just looking out until the raccoon noticed me. He came up to the window, and looked at me. Our noses were like two inches apart (with the glass between us, of course) and he put his little paw up against the glass like he was saying hello. I'd never been so close to a completely wild animal before. It was kind of exciting, and he was really cute. We just looked at each other for a bit before he wandered off.

I thought this was neat, but I know it's not exactly the most *exciting* story. Still, I really wanted to share it with someone, so I hope you guys don't mind hearing about it :)"

291,0,"I've been seeing this girl for two weeks, and last night I went to her house for the first time and met her family and she drove me around her small town and told me about its history. She held my hand for the first time while we were driving. And then before I left to go home, we hugged for a while. I told her ""You're something else, kid."" She stepped back and kissed me. And then she kissed me again. And then we both just looked at each other, and this crazy thing happened. We both at the same time leaned in and kissed again and it was the most passionate experience I had ever had, even though it only lasted for a second or two.

I've been really depressed for the past two years and she has seriously brought joy back into my life, and I think I've done the same for her. Thanks for letting me share this with you guys!

How is everyone else?! :)"
292,0,"Browsing /r/all the past few days, I've noticed that there are a lot more positive posts than there used to be, and many of the highest rated are from subs like /r/Eyebleach. /r/Wholesomemes seems to be the flagship for this movement, growing in subscribers rapidly and hitting /r/all like a storm.

Yesterday /r/Crazyideas created a new sub, /r/CongratsLikeImFive. It started with silly kids stuff like ""I ate my vegetables"", but today it's filling up with more genuine and mature posts like ""I dumped my abusive gf"" and ""I became financially independent"". These posts are getting a lot of genuine responses. I think a lot of people really want real praise, and others really want to give praise. (Edit: this is a trending sub and already has over 4500 subscribers.) 

I think this positivity movement is great. I think everyone needed a breather after the trainwreck that was 2016, and especially after the bad feelings that the US election season brought. These positive posts are super cheesy, but I've found myself thinking more positively in real life.

What do you guys think of the influx of positive posts? What do you think is causing it? Will it last far into the next year?

Edit: many of you bring up a good point: the /r/all filtering feature and the new voting algorithm seem to have brought down the frequency of posts from the most controversial/highly political/negative Nancy subs."

295,0,"1 year ago, I installed 2 Chrome extensions, the XKCD translator, and another one that delayed an extensions activation, I delayed the translations for 10 months. 2 months ago every single tumblr post I saw said ""spaaaaace"" instead of space, I just dismissed it as a tumblr meme or something. Then I saw in the news, that the Republicans had won the eating contests, I just thought it was a metaphor or something. I also play lots of Pokemon, and randomly, in bulbapedia, Electric type changed to Atomic. I thought it was just how it was called in Japan, and when translated to English, it was actually atomic. Also, I watch lots of movies, and I'm interested in superheroes and saw ""a man dressed like a bat"" instead of batman everywhere, specially reddit, and just thought it was a reddit meme. Not until like 10 minutes ago, while browsing amazon for Christmas presents for my nephews, I saw ""LEGO a man dressed like a bat 3"" I noticed. Saw the XKCD thing in the corner.

Life is weird after college.

Does everybody else feel the same way?

---

Edit: I had no idea how big this would blow up. Now I'm no expert in life, and what works for me doesn't work for everybody but I would like to hand out some tips that helped me through the first half of my 20s. 

1. **Focus on your foundations:** Friends & family, health & wellness, finances, and so on. Having a solid foundation is key to dealing with all the stresses. Having a solid social life works wonders when you have supporting friends and family who really want to see you succeed. Go for a run or walk a few times a week, even if you don't like exercise you will feel amazing afterwards. Start now with putting money into your savings, I recommend starting with at least 10% of you income. Once you have enough in your savings all your financial stresses will disappear.

2. **Explore new things! (aka get out of your comfort zone)** After graduation move to a place you've never lived before, try new hobbies, join different meetup groups, read more, this list goes on. Just get out there and try something new!

3. **Take on more responsibility.** Nothing feels better than knowing you can do something on your own: adopt a pet, move into your own place, aim for a promotion at work, or volunteer outside of work. 

4. **Find something bigger than yourself and contribute towards it.** One of the most common things I've noticed in this thread is people looking for their passions or looking for meaning in their lives. Luckily for you finding meaning isn't that hard, even if it isn't your fulltime job. You can donate to charity every paycheck, volunteer at a local nonprofit, start a fun side project (especially collaborative ones like a podcast or band).

5. **Do fun shit!** Go to music fests, go backpacking, take trips, go out on the weekends. Definitely take advantage of your young energy. I'm doing this by trying to see all the bands that I love live, and traveling a lot more, before life gets in the way. 

Focusing on these things has helped me get through my 20's and build myself into a better person in the process. What works for me might not work for you, but I just thought I'd offer my two-cents. "
297,0,It was actually pretty funny and makes me want to send one to someone.  
298,0,"So I am basically living hand to mouth. I just about clear my bills each month, I eat like a fucking fifteenth century peasant, and if it wasn't for my job I wouldn't have a car. 

I am the fucking happiest man alive right now. I am content with my life and adore the people I surround myself with. I am also within touching distance of a career I have always wanted.  Life is pretty good right now. 

Just thought I would have a brag. 


Edit:  For those who are asking, the career is law enforcement.  In particular, community policing. I want to help vulnerable people.  Where I live organised crime is pretty big, especially in rural areas.  Families and especially kids, fall victim to loan sharks and drug dealers. I want to help stop that.  The selection process is stupidly long. I have the final interview next week.  Shitting myself. 

 Also RIP inbox. "
299,0,"So yeah, we have those emergency sirens that would go off in case of a war or something like that.  
Every year in February those sirens are tested on their functionality by letting them run for a couple of minutes.

It's really creepy and I love it every single year. It sounds exactly as the Silent Hill siren (from the movies). 

Sadly today is really nice weather. When there's a big mist or something it's so damn cool!

Do other countries have those kind of sirens too? Do you test them as well?"
300,0,"It's my birthday today an my wife bought me a pair of [Enchroma Glasses](http://enchroma.com/) as my gift. I never bought a pair because I test as a [strong protan](http://wearecolorblind.com/article/a-quick-introduction-to-color-blindness/) and there is only a 30% chance that these glasses would work for me at all. So far, there hasn't been any real change to the 'reds' that I see, but for the first time ever, a green traffic light looked green to me. Normally they look white. And highway signs...holy cow, they are **green**

I'm pretty excited at what I have seen so far today. I'm hoping that as my eyes get used to the glasses (wearing them gives me a bit of a headache and strong protans can take a few weeks to get acclimated to the glasses) even more colors emerge.

This has been a really exciting day"
301,0,"So in gamer years I am pretty old *(45)*, not saying I am old in life, just old for an active gamer. I run a Street Fighter, specifically Chun Li, channel on YouTube and I've been posting for years now.

At the beginning I didn't really have a purpose other than just archiving what I thought were my cool matches. Eventually I started have a pretty big collection of content but still no one was really watching and I don't particularly blame them... It was a random dude playing a game at a pretty mediocre level.

The latest version of the game came out a little more than two years ago and I have been posting matches as I leveled up. In all it's nerdy glory, I have reached Diamond rank in SFV. Not an incredible feat for thousands of players but at the same time, it means I am in the top 2% of players in the world. And my matches kinda chronicle that journey.

The higher the rank has netted more views and on top of that I have been discovering tech within the game and sharing when I could. Lastly I have captured games beating some of the best people in the world.

So here I am, I am probably playing Street Fighter the best I ever have in my life *(after 30 years of playing)* and my channel has the most viewers it ever has. And as small as that is to probably so many streamers and channels... I am kinda proud of it.

*EDIT:* **WOW!!!**

Crazy way to wake up with so many responses in my inbox! I think I got back to everyone! Sorry if I missed a post and thank you so much for the words of encouragement and congratulations!"
302,0,"And now I have a fiance, and baby boy on the way, an apartment I'm proud of, and my happiness back.  

         After my grandmother passed away I was left her house.  I was born and raised in that house and my grandmother raised me while my mother worked non stop to provide for Grandma, my twin sister and I.    My mother found her husband when I was 13 or so.  But o continued to live with Grandma.  He wasn't the best person with kids.  Just didn't like them.
Anyway, grandma passes away when I'm 20.  
3 weeks after her death, I come home to all my belongings on the curb.  My aunt had power of attorney and taken possession of the house.  Immediately gutting it and selling all the appliances.   I was destroyed.  I couldn't believe my whole life was taken from me like that.  I still haven't talked to my family since. My best friend let me stay with him for a bit. But I couldn't take the heart ache of being in my hometown, having to see my gutted home.   I found a job 3 hours away and took it.  Apartment Maintenance.  Perfect I thought.  I've always been the handy man being the only male in the house hold.  
And life took off from there.  Succeeded in my job.  Connected with a old fling and ended up falling head over heels for this girl.  She now has a ring on her finger and a baby in the womb.  I can proudly say that I am at my best right now and I needed to tell someone about it.  
I love my life.  
I love you Grandma RIP 
You'd be so proud of me.

Seeing through a mirror as a window

I was told to post here from r/seriousconversation

A broken mind is not so strange anymore, so much moves and changes and yet you feel as if you stay still, never changing, never growing. Suddenly I changed, im excited but also afraid. Not of everything else but of myself. I am prone to change internally, i fear that i fear myself. I scoff at suicide and yet i don't feel its farfetched that i might go that way. I am able to reason that one's reflection may indeed be fake. Cogito ergo sum. Afterall there is no reason why death should not be like before birth, against this logic i still find myself terrified of the end that will not likely be for many years and yet i fear may happen immediately. My greatest weakness is my misunderstanding, i crave closeness so when i am offered reprieve i go to far or i find for once im not being my average characature Max and instead cheater, liar, sociopathic Max. I am scared writing this as my thoughts quicken and i am brought hope by a few things. 1. My dream of being loved by someone completely isnt remote, there are so many people in this world. 2. I will likely live for a long time. 3. I have read that one's attitude changes each decade, i hope this is true.

""I made an A!""

But, when a someone fails, it is not uncommon to hear, 

""The TEACHER failed me.""

318,0,"You meet a girl who seems like just another gal. It feels good to be around her and she makes you laugh. Shortly after that you realize you'd rather spend time with her than with anyone else you know. You have a few fights, but you make up each time. You start to understand her better, and you start to understand yourself better. 

One day you realize that you love her. And when you tell her, she's so happy. You just told her you love her. It's not a favor. It's not something you chose. It just happened. And yet, when you tell her she's so happy, and you're so happy. 

Then one day, you realize that this is it. That this person you just met one day and who was just a cool gal a few years ago but is now the most important person in your life.

Anyway I was googling Barbara Bush and that led to Abigail Adams somehow and I was on her wiki page. Before I knew it I clicked on First Lady Of The United States and saw FLOTUS in parenthesis. Then it all clicked. It’s not an insult or anything negative. It is literally just an abbreviation for President of the United States and First Lady........

Little did I know the biggest challenge of my life was about to start. 

My boy was diagnosed with ASD before he turned two. I know it's been only 2 years but it feels like forever. He's 2.5 now. I had to learn how to hold him, talk to him, get thru to him, play with him, feed him, give him a bath, everything I thought I knew was completely useless. Autism is a whole other world. 

Sometimes I get a little discouraged when I see other little ones calling their mother, telling stories, dancing, just normal toddler things and I wonder if I ever will experience at least my boy call me ""mom"", I'd love to hear his voice. 

This evening, while my husband and I were brushing his teeth in the bathroom, he suddenly turned to look at himself and us in the mirror and said: ""Hi"" 

Then, he said it over and over again with the biggest smile, looking at us and giggling. My heart melted and for once I feel hopeful. That voice was the sweetest voice I've ever heard.

I am in the process of updating my wardrobe and got a beautiful watch from my parents.

Tomorrow I am invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in 3 years and we are going to a Gothic club. Sunday I am baking cake to share with my team at work.

Things are just really looking good right now even though I am not a bit closer to actually being successful when it comes to girls but caring less seems to be a decent first step.

For the past few days it's been alright, I go to work, I use ASL to communicate with coworkers, and I bring a whiteboard pad with me for any words I don't know in ASL, which happen to be every word but ""thank you"" and ""you're welcome."" So really I only use ASL to say thanks and vice versa. But things have been okay! Except for the fact that I can't laugh...I never realized how hard it is to stop the urge to laugh. I can't read Group Chats with my friends since they're too funny, I skip out on certain subreddits (except /r/funny, rim shot!) to avoid making me laugh, and I can't watch my favorite tv shows since they always make me burst! We take things for granted like electricity and agriculture but man personally I took laughter for granted. "
324,0,"My dad ate a mango once when he visited Egypt, and even though his Egyptian friends hyped it for him and praised its delicious flavor, he still thought it wasn't that great. He said it tasted horrible, in fact.

But I was surprised to see mangoes at the local bazar a few days ago and (like an idiot) asked the guy how much for a kilo, as if I was buying tomatoes. He said, ""These are sold by quantity. One mango for 7.5 Liras."" I immediately knew I had to try it, no matter the cost, so I just picked one (they all looked identical) and said, ""Bag it!"" 7.5 Liras could get me two kilograms of apples, for comparison.

I ate it today! I watched a video which explained how to cut and dice a mango properly. Compared to the one in the video, my mango felt more robust and less fleshy. Also, it looked visibly greener, with almost no redness on the outside. However, it tasted really good. It had a hint of carrot with orange, all sweetened mildly.

I could very much see mangoes being one of my favorite fruits. Alas, they don't grow in or around where I live, and so they have to be imported, which makes them expensive and available only for a few weeks each year.

What is your favorite fruit? What is a fruit (or food item) that you got to try, and what were your impressions? Discuss :P

Afterwards I told him that I thought he was a great friend. He'd handled a difficult situation that might pressure other people into going along with the crowd, but he didn't judge and stuck by his friend. 

I was proud of him. But what followed made me feel even prouder. 

He went on to say ""that's what *another friend* said when he told me he was gay. He said he trusted me because I don't judge.""

He told me this so casually, didn't faze him in the least. 

And that's when I learned that, thank goodness, the world is changing. Slowly, person by person, the world is changing for the better. 

I shared this with a friend tonight and teared up. I'm proud to know a person like my son who doesn't pass judgment, who knows who he likes, sticks up for his friends (even against his friends). 

There's a saying that standing up against your enemies is hard, but standing up to your friends is harder. This kid does it. He's way braver than I was at his age, possibly even now. 

We have a lot to learn from our kids. 

EDIT: Hey everyone! I apologize for the late replies. I posted this last night and was at work all day. Busy day, it was!

Thanks so, so much for the gold and the kind words - it was beautiful to read how touched some of you were. 

My son really is a great kid. I definitely make a point of telling him how proud I am. More importantly, I remind him that he should be proud of himself. 

Thank you all again. :)"

Regardless, the first thing I felt when the EMT started asking me questions was jealousy. I feel like I'm crazy but that's literally the first thing I thought, ""This guy knows all this medical stuff and I don't."" 

I'm interested in the medical field but I wasn't sure if it was right for me or not or if I was making the right decision, but if the first thing I feel is jealousy after blacking out then I feel like that's more proof than anything. I'm kind of glad in a way. "

It was minding its own business, so I let it be as I poured the coffee into my mug. I was happy to have a little company in my morning routine, no matter how small the companion. I smiled watching it fly aimlessly around me, marveling at the freedom such a creature must have. Then, to my horror, the suicidal bastard flew straight into my steaming hot coffee. I was stunned, wondering what kind of problems it must have been facing to think death by drowning in burning liquid was the answer. Shaken over the turn of events, I remorsefully emptied my cup, and the little guy, down the drain. RIP fruit fly, you will be missed."

345,0,"I don't know if it's normal or not but for all of my life I've had a hard time understanding words in songs. I listen to a huge variety of different music and almost all of the time I just can't tell what the words being sung are. I usually look up the lyrics if I like a song because I don't know what it's really about until I read the words.

I've noticed this also happens when people talking to me. Unless they speak clearly I have to ask them to repeat themselves, sometimes more then once. 

Is this a normal thing? Do other people hear all the words but not all instruments? I've never really thought about this until now. I feel like I'm missing parts of music because I don't look up lyrics to everything.

352,0,"My boyfriend - my sweetest, most loving, most adorable, precious babe of a boyfriend - made *something* last night, and I ate it, and I don't regret it, though my stomach does. 

He never makes food. He says he's bad at it. He has tremors in his hands sometimes so he doesn't trust himself around sharp things. Which is totally understandable. I've never needed him to cook. But last night at midnight he suddenly got a bug in his brain about using the avocados before they went off, and he went to make guacamole. 

I decided not to mother-hen, but heard a lot of weird sounds and smelled a lot of weird smells. I crossed my fingers for him. 

I guess it didn't go so well - he was trying to use a blender to blend the avocado, and it kept exploding on him. He also clogged and overflowed the sink. But the real concern is that he eventually dropped the blender, plugged in, into the full and overflowing sink, and it ruined the motor but I am just glad he somehow didn't electrocute himself. 

What he was able to salvage of the guacamole was... I mean, it was something. We had no salsa or fresh vegetables to put in the guac. He wouldn't tell me what he put in it until after I tried it. It was interesting. He told me, beaming with pride, how he had gotten experimental with flavors, and had mixed in soy sauce, barbeque sauce, poultry seasoning, and some other ""secrets"" along with the heaping chopped garlic and metric ton of lime juice. He said it never touched the sink, but smelled vaguely of dishsoap. And I didn't tell him, but there was a single large clump of lint and hair that somehow made its way in there. 

And I looked at his sweet little face and I just couldn't tell him it looked and smelled like Gerber for Cthulu. 

I ate that whole bowl with him. He was so proud to make something. I had to eat it. I picked out the lint, but I ate it. 

Now my stomach feels HORRIBLE. I'm at work, and I'm glad he doesn't know. He has an iron stomach so he's fine today. 

The price you pay for love. I adore that man. Anyone else ever eat anything horrible to support your better half?

Edit: I had no idea my guacamole story would be so appealing! For those concerned, yes, he is a functional adult and is better at a great many things than I am. He's fine, just odd, and very sweet. Also, I'm upvoting everyone whether they're nice or not because my guy makes me feel upvoted in real life even when I'm shitty and I think it might be nice if everybody gets to feel that way today."

On youtube, you see the usual ""fuck those n-word we should lynch them"", which is easily ignorable (thought it gets to you after a while). While on Reddit, people write so formally about how ""Black culture is problematic and people who 'practice' it should be eradicated because it's helping no one."", then they get gold, thousands of upvotes, thousands of replies with people just agreeing. Then you have the sarcastic comments about how ""Oh yeah, and the *real* racists/idiots are white.""

I don't know. I really wish I were not black sometimes. I'm tired of living in countries where I'm seen as inferior no matter what. One group of idiotic people who happen to be black just ruins it for us all, but an entire idiotic nation with people who happen to be white has nothing to do with the world population of whites.

It really sucks.

356,0,"Just take a moment to think about the kind of person who bikes? 

I realized one of the reasons I've started biking a lot more, recently, is because I've been too broke to afford gas. Some people bike because they can't afford a car at all. Or maybe they're just being fiscally responsible.
Or they are trying to lose weight.
Or they are trying to be environmentally friendly.
Or they ride a bike for their job.

I can't think of too many other reasons an adult would bike, but, to me, these seem like pretty major things to balance/work for in life. Being broke is hard. Trying to be healthy is hard. Sticking to your morals is hard. Working a minimum wage job is hard.

And, I just feel like by stealing a bike you are hurting someone way more than you could know. It may seem like the victim has an easy solution (just buy a new bike) - but, often that isn't the case. But, as a struggling college student, I have no clue how I would be able to afford to replace my bike (or the tires!). Losing a bike has such a huge impact on a person's life. Maybe this becomes the reason they stop trying to lose weight. Maybe now they can't get anywhere and it becomes even harder to climb out of poverty. Maybe they just stop caring about the world a little more. Maybe they lose their job.

With the new semester starting I've been seeing bikes everyday and it's had me thinking about others."

I figured that an excuse to ask her would be for me to buy something so I just bought some bread and found her alone on her line.  Perfect moment yeah?  Well... YEAH!  so I paid for the bread, started sweating and shaking,  said thank you and then I got out of the supermarket.  I'm such a loser(I thought to myself.  This summer I missed so many opportunities and I promised myself that I'll never miss another one, I must do this NOW!)  

SO BEHOLD,  i turn around in my tracks,  enter the supermarket,  ignore the Arab lady that was buying chicken,  and head straight for the girl. "" excuse  me,  this may be a bit odd,  I think you are absolutely cute and I'd like to take you out for a drink.  Can I have your number?""  to which she looked amazed at me and said ""I see that you've been trying to do this for some time""  so I just smile and hand her my phone,  In which she writes her number.

He recognizes me, but then we’re quickly drawn back in the mosh. Anyway, later we meet up again, we have a talk (I tell him how he was one of our favorite teacher, he used to play Led Zeppelin quietly during our tests), asked him for a photo (which he refused, for his career, which I totally understand), had a beer, then wished him a good evening. I know it doesn’t seem that incredible but it was so strange, like out of all of the places I expected to see one of my teacher again, this was definitely not one.

Yes it's one of those situations.. I'm in love with a girl that I've been friends with for a little over a year now and I'm going to finally sack up and tell her tomorrow, on V-Day, how I feel. (With some candy too)

I have no idea hows she's going to respond. I'm excited and scared shitless at the same time. I've also never done something like this, so who knows what'll happen.

This sub has always been super supportive and I wanted some reassurance so I don't pussy out again.

Wish me luck friends.

Edit: By the way, I'll update tomorrow. Thanks everyone!

Edit 2: No I will not be dropping something on her like ""I love you so much and it's Valentine's day, please be my girlfriend"". I'm an awkward guy, but I'm not *that* awkward.

Edit 3: We're getting together this evening. I'll update after on how it goes. You are all amazing people.

Edit 4: Didn't turn out too well. I kind of messed up though and didn't give myself enough time to tell her everything I wanted to. I feel like I have a lot more to say to her so I might ask her to just talk about the situation fully soon. She said she's already talking to another guy, so that's why she's just friends with me. It sucks, but I guess it's not the worst case scenario. We're going to continue to be friends (I know a lot of people think that's a bad idea) and life will go on. I'm pretty down right now but honestly I feel good at least knowing she still wants to be friends. I have her the candy anyway and she loved it, which felt really nice. At least I have a little closure for now and I'm not just stuck wondering. 

Long story short:

I asked her for a real date. She asked why. I told her I really like her and told her we should go out, like for real, not just as friends. 

I kind of froze up when she said she was already talking to another guy. Had no idea how to respond because that was the one thing I didn't see coming. I just said something like ""oh okay, well it's alright"". I ended up giving her the candy though and she seemed really excited about it. I want to say more to her but I don't know how much more. 

She gave me one of the cookies though, which was nice.

Thank you all so much for the support, this sub is fucking amazing.

Last edit: She said she's down to talk about it more next time we get together.

Last last edit: We talked. I told her everything I wanted to. We're still friends. All is well. "
361,0,"Sorry if this sounds like bragging but I'm pretty excited about it. I graduated college with about 30K (US) in student loans. Almost immediately after college, I landed a pretty cool engineering job. When I saw the suggested plan of paying off the loans over 120 months and compared it to my income and expenses, I was determined to have my loans paid off quickly and not become a huge burden on my life. So I made a plan to spend most of my extra income on my loans, while still keeping a decent chunk of money available I'm case of emergencies. 


After a several months on the job, I realized that my work would require a ton of overtime. There were  several weeks where I worked 90+ hours. Almost all of this extra OT went straight into my loans. 


The best part? I graduated in the spring of last year, and made my final payment in the beginning of last month. So I managed to pay off the 30K in about 15 months. The big benefit to paying it off quickly was that the accumulated interest was not that much. 


So to all you college students, prospective students, and graduates: students loans don't have to be this huge scary thing and are manageable. I will admit that I was pretty damn lucky, but loans don't have to be a horror story."

366,0,"My mom had my sister at 16 and me at 20. She was married to my biological dad for 12 years and finally left him when him being a POS & cheater (found this out in adulthood - she never wanted my sister and I to know) became too much. She wrote my sister and I a letter explaining the divorce and how we're all a family no matter what. She struggles to express emotion but still found a way to make us feel like we understood this transition and that we were loved. 


She put up with and handled my sisters drug addiction the best way possible. My sister now has a good job with a pretty kick ass 4 year old son. When I was experimenting with drugs in high school she never yelled at me she just said ""you know I love you. You always have somewhere to come home to after a bad night. Just remember that you don't control the drugs, they control you."" I stopped using a few months later. We were never grounded because she didn't believe in that. Her rule for parties was ""don't get in a car with a drunk driver and call me if you need me."" I called her a few times and I still haven't ever been in the car with someone who had been drinking. 


She has always been so supportive of me and my education. I moved out of my home state as a teenager & she flew down to help me get settled. About a year later, she moved here too & I moved back in with her and my step dad (really great guy). 


She cried when I got my Bachelors degree because not only am I first generation but her biological father didn't know I existed until recently (Facebook is how he found out) and he stopped being in her life when she was pregnant at 16. She said she felt overwhelmingly proud she has two children who turned out so well bc the start was really hard.


I'm currently in a masters program and she is SO supportive. She always tells me to not let anyone else control my life and to never out ME on hold for a partner. I told her I don't think I want children. From what I've seen, usually the response is ""you will when you're older."" Her response was to tell me that it's OK if I don't want kids and life can be fulfilling without them. 


I told her I'm going to Scotland in September as a solo traveler & now she's coming with. I'm stoked. She's never been to Europe. We've never taken a trip together. 


She's just a really amazing person and I love her so much. I feel so lucky that I have such a cool, selfless, and confident woman for a role model.

367,0,"I've been living in Brooklyn for about two and a half years. I came here to do stand up comedy (I'm a complete unknown, no videos online, don't bother looking). And I've certainly liked parts of it. I enjoy performing, I enjoy writing. I like the comedy scene. Most of the people are pretty cool. I hate show business, and getting gigs, and comedy clubs suck, too. I have strong opinions on two-drink-minimums and table service during a show. I hate the culture of hustle that pervades every sort of artistic career pursuit. The love of the hustle. Even more so, I see that appreciation for strife seeping into everything in New York. In part, I moved here *because* it would be tougher. I wanted to put an edge on my blade, the sharpest one I could, and I believed that meant I needed to go to the world capital of comedy and struggle. 

To start, I lived in a seven and a half by nine foot windowless room with five roommates for the steal of a price, $540 a month! I didn't have enough kitchen counter space for the cutting board, so I had to cut carrots, and onions, and stuff sitting at my desk in my room. I've moved twice since. I'm in a *slightly* better place now. I have two windows! And more than enough counter space to work with. Though, it tends to crawl with cockroaches... and a mouse or two...

I do like my job. I've embraced the full Brooklyn hipster way of life. I'm a barista, I sell gourmet ice cream sandwiches, I'm a cyclist (though I did that before I moved here). Its my cousin's business and she's a fucking boss. And I'm lucky as all hell to have her here kicking so much ass that I can lend a hand and pay my rent off of it. 

The dam began to break about a month ago when I was talking a friend of mine at work. He's a Midwesterner that's been in New York about as long as I have. We chatted up the move to Los Angeles, since the move-to-LA always seemed like next aimless step to take when you've run out of reasons to stay in New York. I just kept thinking about what life out there would be like. I saw a bigger apartment or even a house. I saw better weather for bike riding.

I should say I'm pretty heavy into my bicycles (I only have two bikes because I can't afford a third), and I just kept thinking about my bicycles and riding. Riding in New York, riding out west, riding in my home town, Baltimore. And it clicked in me. There are no windy streets in New York. There are no fun streets that curve along a hill or river. I do live near Prospect Park, but that's the only fun 3.3 mile stretch of road in all of Brooklyn. Nothing else for twenty miles that goes through forest. All forms of nature in place only by the municipality's discretion. Everything is snapped to grids of varying angles and lengths. There's a couple paths that follow the Hudson and East rivers, but that's just on the border between the rising metropolis and the rushing waste water it produces. And all these streets are garbage to ride a bike down. I have been day dreaming about riding back in Baltimore. If you know Druid Hill Park, I close my eyes and see those streets. And on top of that, I can actually ride out of Baltimore City and into the county through gorgeous fields and forests, up and down windy, curving hills.

I realized I have put my quality of life on wager. I put up with discomfort and shitty streets for hope of *something* happening with comedy, but who would I be if kept pushing myself to accept a certain level of misery for hope? It was bad. Winter 2016, I had diarrhea for three months which drove me into a deep depression and a complete nervous breakdown back in October. Throw in a few heartbreaks to salt the wound. During all this I wondered about moving home in sadness and defeat, but I didn't. I resisted that. Now, I've been stable for a few months and getting myself to create more. That's started to revolve more around writing and illustrating. Two things I don't need to be in New York to do.

The move-to-LA fell apart. Maybe one day, but I don't need a new city, right now. That's a whole new adventure I'll take on again someday. I needed to move out of my hometown, but I've been away long enough to make another change. I just want to live somewhere around people I love (and I have a lot of those in Baltimore) where I can ride my bike the way I want. This is the happiest I've felt in a long time."

374,0,"My brother isn't too happy with me haha. In my defence, my nephew has been talking about Minecraft for 2 years, never played it, but watches all the YouTube videos and whatnot. Suffice to say I ""crushed it"".


*edit to clarify some things: first off, some of the hostility based off 5 sentences is HILARIOUS haha. So Christmas is not a competition, it's just that my brother and SIL feels there's better things an 8 year old could be doing instead of being planted in front of a TV, so that's why they haven't got him any video games. Their kids, their house, their rules. For whatever reason though my nephew has had an OBSESSION for 2 years about Minecraft, even though he never got to play. So ""a video game being better that a puppy"" is only the case because it would be like getting a puppy and a unicorn, the unicorn would be slightly more distracting at first lol. Also, I called them before I bought it and got permission! So it wasn't a surprise by any means. The game stays at my place, so the puppy will get aaaallll the attention anytime he is at home. Lastly, my brother wasn't actually MAD like ""dude what the FUCK!"" But more like ""damn, good job, you made his Christmas"".

They are very grateful and excited about the puppy and this didn't tear my family apart or anything 😁 happy New Year, drive safe this weekend!"

i know this is a generalization, but it makes me mad because I've gone through shit in order to be where I'm at and sterotyping me into this group of people is just lazy.

386,0,"I was a a Relativity school out of town. I was walking back to the place I was staying to get my bags and I saw a small dead mouse on the street. 


Then his foot twitched.


I knelt and saw that he was still breathing. There was no blood. I took him in my hand and he didn't try to flee. I thought he had been hit by someone and that he was dying, and I figured to keep him company during his last moments. 


He started getting better. More active. I took him to a vet and he's a bit ~~I'll~~ ill. The vet gave him a few shots and I called my airline about their rodent policy. 


Not allowed. 


I wasn't going to leave this little guy to die, so I decided to take him with me. He's small and calm and I got through security with him in my pocket. Now I'm waiting to board the plane. 


They just called us to board. I hope he fares well in the cabin. He's sleeping now. I have him in a shoe box. 

  EDIT: We've landed safely! He's a bit more active now. I can't take pictures because there's people around and at least one person will freak out. I'm still one hour from home so I'll update accordingly!

EDIT 2: **We've arrived safely at home!** It was scary because I had to board a small van for about an hour before taking a cab to get home. I didn't dare to look in the box while in the van because it was really crowded and things could've gone VERY wrong! But I took a peek in the cab and he was fine! I got home and I (unfortunately in this case) own two cats so I can't just leave him around. I don't have a proper cage (yet, it's 2:15 am here) so I put a LOT of holes in a large tupperware container and transferred little Planck there. I'm really tired but I still [**put up a small album for you all!**](http://imgur.com/a/kfdeZ). I'm happy he made it safely, and tomorrow and on Monday I'll look for a vet to finish his treatment. He's still weak. Thank you all for staying tuned to the story. I'll keep you up to date!

EDIT 3: [Short video of Planck devouring a piece of bread.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG4VsGXD5Kw) His right eye is still closed.

EDIT 4: Planck survived the night! He was probably stressed because he was in a tupperware container. The cats didn't get to him. Today I walked to the closest pet store and [bought a hamster cage](http://imgur.com/a/Vty01) for him! He's much more active, he's moving around, and his right eye finally opened. I know the cage is small, but that's the largest they had at the local store. I'm going to look for a larger one later today or throughout the week.

Thank you all for your advice! It's been a weird experience. I never thought I would smuggle a live mouse in my pocket through airport security. For those of you who are worried about harming the ecosystem: The flight was a local flight from Bogotá to Medellín, Colombia. According to the vet, Planck is a mus musculus, which is the common domestic mouse. They are quite common in both cities, so the ecosystem shouldn't be at risk. The one thing that worries me is the possibility of him carrying some disease (contagious to humans or cats). I'll check again with a vet soon.

EDIT 5: It's been a bit over 24 hours since I found Planck lying on the floor, seemingly dead. It's been a strange day. But now I've set him up in a cage, and I've been checking on him throughout the day and he's been sleeping -- actually curling up and sleeping, not just sitting motionless. He's been active, I've seen him grooming himself, eating, and walking around a bit. I'll take him to a vet tomorrow to get him checked again. Several of you have suggested to get another mouse to keep him company, and I think I will! It's not hard to take care of these guys and I don't want Planck to get lonely and stressed out. His cage is out of reach from the cats.
Thank you all for keeping up with little Planck! **ALSO** I didn't notice this since it was buried in my inbox, but /u/aweebitevil has gilded my post! Thanks a lot!"

I don't know what happened. I woke up today and checked his cage and he was lying face up, not breathing. He was stiff. 

I don't know what happened. I gave him food and bedding and water and I don't know. He was dead this morning.

393,0,"I am so amazed at how far I've come in such a short amount of time. I mean, all of these things were on my goals-for-2015 list, but to actually achieve them feels amazing, and kind of surreal.

To give a bit of a background, I homeschooled from age 11 on and never properly earned a diploma. Most of what I know has been self-taught. To add to that, it was self-taught in Canada. I immigrated a year and a half ago to the US, then just completed the US's GED program, which has a totally different curriculum (and recently became a lot harder in 2014). 

Sitting in college orientation was the first time I have been in a classroom in over 15 years. It felt so surreal, yet also familiar. After the original anxiety passed, I was at home again. I always loved school as a kid and, apparently, that never went away.

To add to that, not only did I pass my college assessments, but I did so at the honors level! I'll be starting college at 27 in honors classes, with my own desire to learn as the only real thing that put me there.

I don't want this to come off as egotistical in any way. I just feel so proud and happy with myself for coming this far. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and lived mostly at home taking care of my parents, with no real social life or experience in the world. Yet, here I am.

Never give up. :)
