0,1,"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 "
1,1,"I look normal on the outside, but that's because I try very hard to."
2,1,"Does anyone else feel this way?  This has been crossing my mind a lot lately

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments I've been recieving.  It's been a nice change and I really appreciate it.  You guys are the best.  :)"
3,1,Thank you all for the supportive messages. It’s heartwarming to know that I’m not alone. I know we can all get through this together. I love each and every single one of you 
4,1,"My mom and 13 year old sister died in a car crash yesterday. Tomorrow is thanksgiving. I'm feeling really sad and alone. Really sad and really alone. And I have tears in my eyes. I'm 24 and have no other family. It's just me now. I'm feeling really really sad. It hurts in my chest. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I feel like I'm in a cage, aw really small cage. It's really sad. I'll never get to see them again. I no longer have a family. I'm really really sad. And I'm angry. I'm really angry. But I'm not going to do anything about anything. I don't have a girlfriend so no shoulder to cry on. And even if I did I probably would feel ashamed to. The way I see it I don't really want to live. I'm not suicidal. I'm just very very sad. All I have to remember them by is their ghosts in my head as memories. My jaw is hurting from clenching. And I'm just really sad. This isn't the first big sad thing that happened to me. There's a book series called series of unfortunate events. My life is a lot Like that book only it get worse with every event. It has now snowballed into this. I'm expecting something even worse to happen because that's been my whole life. And the only good thing in it is gone now. My mom and sister. I miss them so much. I miss them so much. "
5,1,"I'm discouraged today! :D 

Edit: This is a bit overwhelming. But reading all your comments was lovely. I hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day. I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day ❤️"
6,1,"Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened."
7,1,
8,1,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible
"
9,1,"As the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything. I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.

Anyone else feel like that?"
10,1,This happens to me a few times a year. It's like my brain is teasing me.
11,1,"I don't know if I'm depressed or if I've just lost my personality and identity. I don't know if this is me now or what? 
I'm nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it. 7 years back dad said it was just a stage I'm going through, yet here I am. All my friends are still themselves I'm completely fucking different"
12,1,
13,1,
14,1,"Dreaming is also a bonus. Sure the occasional nightmares are bad, but at least it's better than being awake, where you feel bad 100% of the time."
15,1,"it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. Most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like ""your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen"". I don't know. 

EDIT: Hey so i'm not the only one who feels this way. If anything it's slightly comforting to know that

EDIT 2: Yes i'm aware of the spelling mistake in the title, it's kinda hard to spell correctly when you're rambling at 11 pm"
16,1,
17,1,"I am one of probably millions of people who where told as kids how intelligent they were, but I don't see it in myself and I can't live up to those expectations put upon me. In middle school I got lazy and relied on my ""intelligence"" too much. Now I i feel like everyone has surpassed me just because my naive 10 year old self thought that I was somehow special or above average. Now in almost everything I score below average and can't keep up with others. Its been like this for all of the latter part of middle school and my high school years. now as everyone else is just about to graduate, its not even clear if I even will graduate. Everyone has clear goals and ambitions where as I don't see any real future for myself."
18,1,"It's so weird. If I'm in a good mood, I'm totally optimistic and actually willing to put in the effort to improve myself/my life (e.g. start volunteering, go to a MeetUp group, get fitter etc). But then something happens, like as simple as a bad day at work. And suddenly all those plans fly out the window and my new plan is figuring out my suicide method, genuinely planning to go through with it. And look back at my ""positive"" self and think ""... wtf was I thinking? I wish I was dead."""
19,1,
20,1,"Still want to die. Still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. Still a burden to everyone in my life. 

Edit: went to bed after writing this post (I say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your kind words. 

Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments. I'll be honest, I just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but I appreciate this community so much. "
21,1,Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.
22,1,"While cuddling of course. 

Edit 1: I fucking love all of you

Edit 2: So many people in the US, no one is down under :("
23,1,"Now I'm not in school, can barley make rent, have no friends, family gave up on me. It's sad. It really is a travesty "
24,1,I just open up steam and endlessly stare at my library.
25,1,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. "
26,1,"I have been through a roller coaster of absolute pain and there is no light at the end of the tunnel that isn't just more of this roller coaster ride. The people close to me no longer show concern because that's just who I am to people now. They either don't know me, or they know how much I'd love to not exist but am still not strong enough to put an end to it. And that's the thing isn't it?  
  
**Nobody cares until you're gone.** Nobody cares until you can 'prove it'. We're 'attention seekers', except I've isolated myself from everyone and I don't communicate how I feel anymore to anyone but internet strangers who also don't know me and therefore don't care.   
  
Unless you're actually about to pull the trigger, people would prefer if you shut up, fucked off, stop bringing down the mood, stop being a burden, you're simultaneously too much and yet not enough.     
  
They don't care what's causing my misery. God forbid I mention a person, or people are the stressors to what I'm feeling. That is manipulation. Suicidal people are manipulative. We just latch on to people and bring them down.  
  
I'm sorry. I don't want to be this way. I have asked, pleaded, begged for help. Nobody has offered anything to actually help me. Throwing vague suggestions and hotlines and websites isn't help. Leaving me to figure out my own shit does not help.   
  
At the very least I have learned how to bottle most things up. Nobody will have to worry about hearing about my pain. And eventually, hopefully soon, nobody will have to worry about me at all.
  

  Edit: I think a lot of people misunderstood. Nobody in my inner circle is foreign to mental health struggles. My mother is half the reason I have them, biologically speaking. We have similar symptoms. I've made it clear what kind of help I need and what I need help with to get there. I'm shrugged off because my struggling with suicidal ideation is not as pressing of a matter as whatever else is going on.  This was also general observation of how people react to suicidal people."
27,1," People my age should be out living life and making memories but here I am feeling like shit in my room alone. Every fucking week it's the same shit. I just exist, I don't live. "
28,1,
29,1,"Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. I would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and I didn't realise until I was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back. "
30,1,"This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
31,1,"I know that's not a solution to depression, but it's something I think about a lot as well as other things that depression consists of. 

I just imagine myself taking off, somewhere far away, near a nice beach, and just simplifying my life. Not telling anyone where I've gone, not speaking to friends and family ever again. Just...disappearing. 

Edit: 

Some of you brought up the point that our problems are internal and not external. I know that, but that doesn't stop me and my mind from thinking of taking off. "
32,1,Normally my mother or aunt is helping me shower since I'm terrified of showering and usually am forced to bathe . I just don't feel like I'm worthy of bathing. But today I was home alone and I decided to shower today by myself . It felt scary but great. I usually am terrified I'll fall or drown or some weird crap. But today I did it alone..
33,1,I would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes I wish something else would just do the job for me. 
34,1,"My parents keep asking me this question.
Today I decided to talk. 

I told them about everything and I answered their questions.
After I had talked they told me: ""You don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.""

I didn't respond.

 They said: ""Oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!""
Then they left saying:""You can be such a dick when we try to talk to you.""

This is why I don't talk to you.

Edit: Just read through the comments. Thanks guys. It really means something to me."
35,1,"This quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression I've ever encountered in literature. One of the few times I'm actually startled by my own reflection. Just thought I'd share.

I'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too."
36,1,
37,1,"I find that I've been going to sleep earlier and earlier. It's not that I'm tired, but I know that no one will bother me or talk to me while I'm asleep. It's the one thing I can do to make everyone leave me alone...does anyone else do this?"
38,1,"The best explanation I could come up with when a friend of mine asked. 

EDIT: I'm glad so many of you could relate. Keep on fighting to find your home. "

40,1,"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."
41,1,"I can't go on. Im after finishing a 26oz bottle of vodka hoping to numb the pain even a little but it fucking ddidn't work. Im in a secluded parking lot in my car staring at my gun and ignoring all 100+ missed calls and shit I cant deal with it. Im going to kill myself within the hour. 

Suppose I feel like I had to write this down somewhhere.

45,1,R.I.P Robin Williams
46,1,"Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys."
47,1,No friends to celebrate with but cheers!
48,1,and then you just stay in bed and browse Reddit and pointless crap the whole day and then feel guilty for procrastinating. But then you promise yourself to do it tomorrow or some other day and it happens again and the cycle just keeps repeating and you just keep feeling guilty again and again
49,1,"There was more blood than toothpaste in my mouth by the end but hopefully I can keep doing it. The pain felt good.

edit: whoah that blew up..."
50,1,I feel like nothing makes me happy; even when I'm laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit I still just feel incredibly upset and depressed. Sometimes I actually feel worse.
51,1,I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better. 
52,1,
53,1,"Just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort. It feels like I'm not entirely alone then. My friends can't really get through me and I'm constantly tired. In order for things to change I need to do something, but to do something I need energy... so yeah...

I want to sleep the entire time and I'm much more exhausted in general, but I'm also afraid. Will I feel better when I wake up or worse?"
54,1,"I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014."
55,1,
56,1,"I think the world is beautiful. There are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime. I think people are amazing, and the shitty terrible people don't prevent me from appreciating the good ones (whom I consider to be the majority). To me, life is wonderful. Except I don't like *my* life. I wish I could be somebody different, somebody less mediocre, someone more attractive, more intelligent, more motivated, more adventurous, and more knowledgeable about what I'm looking for in life. I'm 21 and all I can think about is everything I have missed out on and will miss out on in life. I wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else. I don't want to stop playing, I just wish I could start a new game."
57,1,"**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 

***************************************************************************

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".  So our issue is fundamentally not with religion, but the misuse of it.**"
58,1,"after depression there is no more need to live, its as if mental and physical death went out of sync"

61,1,I never know what I need to be happy. How do I figure out what my actual social needs are?

If you can see through my happy facade I'm nowhere near capable of telling you what's wrong without breaking down. If I am somehow capable of telling you, you won't understand and you will forever look at me through different eyes. You will always see my answer to your question written on my face..."
74,1,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Edit 2: still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day."
75,1,"It's ironic that depression is an illness in the first place, yet seems to be the only one that can be cured by willpower alone.

If anyone knows where I can get this ""Snap out of it"" medication I've heard is so effective, I would be so grateful if you let me know where I can buy it from."
76,1,
77,1,"I’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. I mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. It’ll look like an accident” but then I just shake it off. Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with. It’s exhausting. "

My meds started to kick in recently and I've been feeling better but this human garbage ruined my week and I am still furious. Honestly I would never wish this horrible feeling upon anyone but her. 
Edit: thank you all for the support, you have no idea how good all your meaningful comments made me feel. Stay strong if you suffer keep spreading positivity because that's what you all do best! 
Update: Thank you all again for everything you said, as many of you suggested I reported the girl and she got a month of detention, I guess it's the best school can do. 
She never apologized and after reading your responses, I honestly don't care. Stay strong everyone!"

88,1,"I don’t know if anyone will even read this, I just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago I admitted my self into the hospital because I did not feel I could keep my self safe any longer. The next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in.  He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. "
89,1,"So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. 

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. 


I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   

The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. 


There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.


I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day.

102,1,"Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply."

104,1,"Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. "

107,1,I think about killing myself fairly often but I don't think I could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days I wish that I was just alone and no one was around to care so I could just do it 
108,1,"It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart.

115,1,"After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. "

When I struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because ""you know they just put the parents under a microscope"".

I'm officially done. I don't care about these people any more. I told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and I so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all I got was a ""tough love talk"" about ""how I don't deserve to be depressed"". 

You are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid.

I don't know what to do at this point. Suicide sounds like a very convenient option at the moment, but I just don't know how I would go through with it.

I mean, what's the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons? It's exhausting and I feel mentally crippled.

This has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement.

What the fuck is the point?"

Staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon.

Scrolling through your Facebook timeline and wondering who these people are.

Earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food.

Saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack.

Wondering why you still have these problems at 30.

Crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship.

Never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they don't call you."
126,1,I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems. 
127,1,I think it feels like nobody in the world cares.
128,1,"Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-;

Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE**

134,1,"Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success."
135,1,"To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this.

I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion.

147,1,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."

Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take.  I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.  I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff.  I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.  Nothing is interesting to me either, so I am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."""

158,1,"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?"
159,1,"When I go to sign for packages I make a joke everyone he comes about my handwriting. I say 
""please don't judge my writing"" 
  and he usually says
 ""it's alright""  
until the other day he went on to say. 
""You love to sign huh?"" 
And he went on to explain why they require people to sign and how he doesn't mind my terrible scribble. He even smiled and told me to have a good day. This little interaction made my day. As soon as I closed the door I told myself I did good. I held a conversation. It's the little things guys. Stop beating yourself up and focus on the things you've done successfully. Have a great day/night."

161,1,"She had a boyfriend so she had to decline but that's alright, at least she was upfront about it. Just wanted to share this small victory I had today."
162,1,"I don't mean just general regret for your life choices. I mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.

I don't know. I guess I'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again."
163,1,"About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

Edit: Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)"

165,1,"I have tried to write something in this group so many times but I always delete it (I've typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past, but haven't hit send)

So fuck it. 

I'm depressed. I'm dealing with it in my own way. 
I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. 
I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. 

I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. 

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love."

167,1,"In my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that I'm worthless but that other people still have worth. I also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. Because of this, I can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. But with myself, nothing is good enough. Every decision I make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence. 

Are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth?"
168,1,I just need to know im not alone. Im tired of seeing all these people better than me with more skills than I have because I wasted my life playing the video games and being on my phone. I mean right now while I cant concentrate in my calc class everyone else is taking notes and im just here on my phone because I cant understand the material and while everyone else has the capacity to study for hours on end for finals I cant focus for more than half an hour before I take a fifteen minute break. Tldr: dae feel like a loser and hate life
169,1,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life."
170,1,
171,1,"Thanks, depression. I *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet I did it anyway because I felt I didn't have a choice. Now that I put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that ""understand what I'm dealing with"" or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and I know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when I see the pictures or hear about it in passing. I know I can't expect people to still invite me to things when I always decline, especially now when the days that I feel up to being around other people are few and far between. The (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of. "
172,1,I don’t know why but this kept popping into my head today I feel like I’m a paradox.

I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living.

It just doesn't make any sense. I wanted to be dead, but they forced me to stay alive, and now I have to pay them for it. Plus I have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again. I feel like I'm literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills.

183,1,"hey guys . i feel like i owe everyone who suffers from depression an apology. i used to hate seeing people complain about it. i’d say, “must be so hard to live in a nice place in the suburbs with everything you need”. i would look at depressed folks as attention whores and never show them compassion. lots has changed in my life and as a result i’ve been quite depressed for some time. i can’t believe i used to say those things and look at this the way i did. for those of you that suffer terribly, i now have the upmost respect for you. you are fucking troopers. stay strong . [Edit]: all of you are fantastic. thank you ."
184,1,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. 


Thank you all for your comments and love <3

Lots of love,

Jasmine "
185,1,"Like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.
At the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.
When i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.
Not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.
I think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (Yay free shit.)



Edit: It's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, I really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :)."

189,1,"It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to ""save"" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click ""report"" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.  Don't forget that if you need help and don't feel safe posting, you're always welcome to message the moderators. "
190,1,"Welcome to the (ir)regular check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us. If you have concerns or questions about the community policies, this is a good place to raise those as well.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. "
191,1,"Proof:

* The majority of food I eat daily is greens (mostly just spinach and kale)

Today I’m at the very bottom.

213,1,"Inb4 comments like ""you're just acting helpless"" or ""what makes you different from everyone else?"" I'm not trying to act helpless or like I'm different. I just feel like I'm too weak. There a lot of things that upset me that... shouldn't. Like I'm terrified of confrontation, to the point where I start shaking. And I can't have arguments. Everything makes me exhausted, after 10 minutes of badminton I couldn't breathe, even getting excited or nervous gives me a headache. It's like I have no energy, I get so tired when doing schoolwork. And I'm very sensitive to what kind of advice I get, stuff like ""tough love"" gets me close to hyperventilating and I'll be upset for the rest of the day. I just don't know what to do, and I admit it, sometimes I just want to quit. I guess I just have to try harder, but often I feel like I'm too weak and sensitive and I won't make it in the world, and that things would be better if I stopped existing. "
214,1,"sometimes it hits me at 2:49 in the morning when i catch myself in the mirror on the way from kitchen to my room, sometimes in 4pm when i realize how fucking alone i am and wasting the summer doing nothing

i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore"", no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

i had a decent life back in high school, it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral, i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard"
215,1,"[28M] No one knows I am depressed and if they do, they have no idea  how bad it’s gotten. I’ve got bags of trash scattered all around my house, coffee table is full of old bags of takeout and weed. Sink is full of dishes that haven’t been washed since December.  

I live alone but haven’t slept in my bed in over three months (I usually pass out on the couch). I’ve gained over 100 pounds and am severely out of shape (used to be 195 and am now over 300). 

My day consists of waking up at 4am and just sitting there until I find acceptable porn to “wake myself up with”, then I sit on the toilet for about 40 minutes until I’m able to drag myself into the shower in which I just hose off. 

I get dressed (that’s easy because I put the shirt I slept in back on and wear the same thing everyday but switch hats and shoes. Like I’m fooling anyone.) I then take a little puff of weed and drive to work in silence fantasizing about someone crashing into me or me just swerving off the side of the freeway. 

Work starts at 930 but I usually get there around 7-8am. I work all day as hard as I can because it’s almost like my mind is blank while I’m there. I just go through the motions. At work everyone knows me as the office clown/one of the hardest working people at our company. Our workday is over at 6pm but I usually stay til around 8pm. Being at work from 7am-1am is not out of the ordinary for me and people even joke about me being the first and last to leave. 

On the way home, I find some take out and head in. The first thing I do when I get home is smoke as much as I can then eat and turn on the office. I usually either watch the office or play video games or both while I have porn or a cam show going on my phone. I usually choose cam shows because it makes me feel less lonely. 

I smoke some more and usually get so high that I pass out around 9-10pm then I wake up at 4 and do it all again. Rinse and repeat. 

I don’t really know how much longer I can take doing this. I had a good life before all of this and don’t know where I went wrong. There are people in my life who I feel are being held back by my depression and I’m starting to feel like the only way to help any of us is to just disappear. If there were a way for me to do that without hurting anyone I would’ve a long time ago.  "

217,1,"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. 
At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. "

227,1,"My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this. It might be to prevent others from doing this, but I think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  

I found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. I don't mean to diminish this, but I believe it was mostly in her head. She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was. 

Now I feel trapped. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but I also don't see suicide as an option. How can I put my loved ones through what I'm now going through? I can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct. 


Edit: thank you all for your support. I promise that, despite the timing of this, it is not an April's fool joke. I really wish it was. 

Edit 2: thank you again for all the support. I'm going to see someone today and Friday. The funeral is tomorrow. It's going to be a rough few days. "

231,1,"I can't maintain friendships. I can't connect with people. I push people away when I need them the most.

It is so hard to describe the feeling and experience. I look forward to my free time, I plan and structure my life so I have it. But when I reach that point it is like I've gotten dumped off, with a clear schedule and the world at my fingertips.

I should be enjoying life more than ever, but I don't have a social structure to lean on. I've grown apart from my friends and family. I make plans for my days off with people, but when they come I cancel them.

I just lay in bed and stare at the sky through the windows. The only thing that gets me up is caffeine headaches. I probably spent a whole hour today smacking the pull string on the ceiling fan in my bedroom and watched it for 5 minutes until it would stop moving completely and then I would smack it again. It was a boring, tortuous, and arduous experience but I wouldn't stop."
232,1,"This has been a recurring fantasy of mine for years. I'm thinking, well, things can't get much worse, so instead of killing myself how about just leaving everything.

234,1,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm. 

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. 

It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. 

When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. 

At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. "

That being said I just havr to say that I am trying to deal with it and as embarrassing as it may sound I often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak (even if I hate my voice and I find it grating). I am mostly okay with it...I think. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I try to occupy my mind with video games anf music so I don't think about killing myself.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for replying to this, I had no idea it would blow up so much. I was very in my feelings when I made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself. I went to sleep and now I am feeling a little better. 

I promise I will take time to read all the replies and respond to everyone.

238,1,"I'm so tired of hearing ""everyone's depressed"" and ""other people have it much worse than you."" Like I'm completely aware my life should be great and now I just feel bad for complaining?? Are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more? I understand I'm not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because I can't control my emotions but also give me a break.  

*edit: aw, guys. this has really blown up in just over 24 hours. I'm so glad none of us are alone and it's truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view. I have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think i'm feeling. it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem, a chemical imbalance, rather than a bad few weeks. many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to. i kind of wrote this as a rant because i've been frustrated with my ""support system"" blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because i'm highly functioning. i go to work, i run errands, i see friends, but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep. ""you just need to sleep more,"" or ""try to relax,"" or my personal favorite, ""have you tried meditating or yoga?"" HA. we've all been there. 

i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even THINK you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️"
239,1,"I posted this on /r/suicidewatch before I realized this sub existed.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

*EDIT* *UPDATE*

I saw her at visitation tonight and she was very upbeat. She is taking all therapy seriously and seemed to be genuinely happy for the first time. 

I feel a bit better about things. Thanks to all of you for your support. 

*EDIT*

She gets to come home this Sunday. Time to clean the fuck out of her house for her. =)"

I feel more apathy than much else and I don't know if that is depression and I am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis. Some part of me believes I can solve this on my own, but another part asks, ""and how long will that take, considering your less than stellar situation, will and mindset?""

Oh, and then there's the part which definitely thinks I shouldn't waste my time writing this, which in turn may waste your time by reading this. I am just confused and a little tired. I seek no sympathy from you guys, but maybe someone can relate. I wish you all a good day."

I require so much to be happy it seems, I'm such a burden. I'm such a mess. I want to say I have a good heart but that's probably not true and even if it was I think all my shitty qualities outweigh my good ones.

I'm sorry that I seems like I'm throwing a pity party for myself, that's not what I'm trying to do, I just need my thoughts out somewhere.

251,1,"*Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.


The Robin Williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about ""caring."" If I die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. Friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, ""Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just let go of that bad stuff."" 

Obligatory Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! It's my first!"

Often, my moods fluctuate. I can have very high highs, where everything is good and I’m feeling beyond great, then with a simple trigger I can sink into this deep sadness where I go numb and have no interest in doing anything.

255,1,"So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts. Those might be more likely to be a ""cry for help"" scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out. 

Rick Sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it."

Why can't I just have a sane parent? This might sound edgy but I'm not stupid enough for religion to help me.

260,1,"I hate my life. I’m stuck home with my depressed parents who make me feel guilty if I try to have a social life as though i should be at home moping around with them instead. It’s gotten to a point I feel selfish for wanting to go out with friends and if I do, I’m miserable. But I love being around people. I love talking and doing things with others but I can’t anymore. I don’t have anyone. "
261,1,"It’s my birthday today, and I feel way worse than usual. Am I alone in feeling this way?

Edit: WOW this post blew up. Can’t say I had the best birthday, but I very much appreciate all of the people who wished me to have a happy one, and it definitely made me feel better! Common themes that were brought up was that to increase enjoyment of birthdays, it is important to monitor your expectations, put yourself out there and be vulnerable, and know that it is common to feel this way, so therefore just make it your own celebration however you want to. Even if that means doing it alone and treating yourself. Best wishes and thanks again for your support!"

I can safely say feeling disconnected from everything is what makes us the most damage, despite having all of our basic needs satisfied. I guess we all have to learn how to survive with this instead of fighting it, and sharing our thoughts here helps with that a lot.

Regards to everyone and thanks again."
269,1,"one of the things you learn with depression

your life isn't a tragedy to friends and fam, it's a black comedy. you don't get love and support by publicly suffering all the time. only by being great and happy all the time and having a bad day that one time. then they care.

i dunno im drunk, ignore me."

271,1,"No, fuck you. The thing that's selfish is that you expect people to stick around just to keep YOU happy. 
Why do people have such a problem with suicide? If I wanna end it I'll end it. I want out of this cruel world."
272,1,"I swear depression is one paradox. You start on level one, depression goes to level two, you go to two and depression goes to three. In the meantime you tell your self a bunch of bullshit to act like depression isn't taking over and ruining your life but it is. No one understands how awful it is, depression is a life stealing shitshow

There is not rock bottom, it always gets worse. Whenever you think your at the lowest, it goes lower. 

Growing into or enjoying yourself is impossible

Depression has made me a walking idiot

277,1,"I seriously do not remember the last time I felt an emotion that was my own, beyond the alternating crushing ennui and bone-deep sadness that is the depression. 

Any ""normal"" emotions; Happiness, laughter, excitement, even just normal neutrality, all of those are foreign to me. I only ""feel"" them when I'm near someone else who is feeling them, and that's only because I've learned to mimic the behaviors associated with each emotion while in a social setting so nobody will ask what's wrong with me. 

Is this a thing other people do? Or am I just really fucked up?"
278,1,"Not trying to be edgey I just hate the heat and summer, winter is my jam."
279,1,"No calls, no cards, no emails - nothing. It's a big birthday. I always thought I'd be surrounded by my loved ones on my 65th birthday, but not one of them ever calls or writes or sends even a Christmas card to me. One day I'm going to die in this goddamned apartment and nobody will know until they smell something bad and realize they haven't seen me for awhile. Then they will all act so sad. 

I remember at my father's funeral, some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was. I looked at him and said ""Who are you?"" and then I asked him ""If he was such a good friend, why don't I know you? I'm his daughter and I've never seen you in my life.""

When I die, nobody will come to my funeral. Nobody will give a rat's ass that I am dead. That's why I'm donating my body to science.

UPDATE: Just want to thank everyone who posted well wishes or shared their life stories. I wish I had more time to answer all the replies. It really did lift my spirits, though, so you did what you intended to do. This is one reason I love Reddit and why I love young people. They really have such good hearts, but I think maybe they don't want to face their own mortality quite yet, so they tend to turn away from older folks like me. I was the same way when I was younger.

Anyway, thanks again! "
280,1,"I do this all the time, like I really want that feeling of happiness so I smile, but it never comes."
281,1,"I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. 

If you took the time to read this, I thank you. I just needed to vent. 

And to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as I have in the past, please PLEASE seek help. Don't do this to those that care about you. 

EDIT: Wow. I wrote this last night before getting some rest, and I woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. I can't tell you how much it means to me. 

For those that sent me PMs, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. I'll be going through everyone's response today. "

You guys understand how wonderful of a gift that can be. He's almost 100% done--we just need to clean the closet together bc he didn't know which clothes I wanted to get rid of. 

This is a fresh start for me and I promised him I would do my best to keep it like this. This is a good chance for me to get into the habit of taking care of the little things before they overwhelm me and feel impossible. "

I want to die so bad right now and the voices are once again coming back full force, beating me down to the point where I can't focus on anything, I just want to cry and sit in bed, or stab myself repeatedly with a knife. Instead I sit in front of a computer and game for as long as I can. Most of the time I am completely alone with my own thoughts on the weekend. 

Even now my mind is yelling at me. I dread the weekends. "

298,1,"I really don't understand how most people seem to be okay with this. 


I can't stand it. Never been able to. I started skipping school in like fourth grade, dropping out in 9th, and lived at home for a while - depressed about thinking about a future of wage slavery.


Well I tried the thing everyone kept telling me to do and I got a GED and a job and my own apartment and a girlfriend and a dog and I'm miserable. 


I hate living. I hate this existence. I hate work. I hate that this is the only option I have. 


I've tried different jobs, but there isn't a huge selection here - I'm very isolated. I'm also stupid and unskilled and don't see myself doing anything but menial labour my whole life for pitiful wages..


The menial labour is torture, honestly. I feel trapped inside my own mind for 8 hours a day where it just tells me to kill myself, it'd be easier than continuing the shift. I get obsessive about the time and that's only getting worse. Now I can't even enjoy the things I used to because a minute at work feels like four or five times as long as a minute at home. It's so unfair. 


Six days a week I spend 8 hours actively wishing something would kill me and feeling miserable, then I go home and try to relax but I'm too worn out or stressed or sad from work and dreading having to go back. My one day off a week is nice but goes by too fast.


I'm thinking of quitting my job, buying a lottery ticket and killing myself when I lose. At least then I'll have a week or two off until my savings dry up.


I haven't had more than three consecutive days off work *or* enough money left over after bills to make it seem worth it since I started working two years ago.

305,1,"I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. I started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. However, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. How do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? It's not like I really knew the other side, so to speak. It was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.

SO…I made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how I feel. I've always been a more visual person anyway. Hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. Let me know what you think!

308,1,"I didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but I am realizing this right now as I'm in the middle of a crisis. I'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now. Just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, I try not to think about my death. 

While the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. 

So I guess that's a good thing, isn't it?

309,1,"I'm 26 years old. My live in girlfriend of a little over a year committed suicide 10 days ago. She suffered from extreme depression, and possibly borderline personality disorder or another disorder. Was a recovering heroin addict that was on suboxone for the past 9 months and recently tapered off...  After an argument she went out and bought heroin, wrote a suicide note, and then proceeded to do it via overdose. I haven't read the note, and I'm afraid of what it's going to say. I'm so completely crushed. Every day since then I've literally cried from the moment I wake up, and throughout the day randomly until I physically can't cry anymore...  I feel like this has really messed me up in the head. I don't know what to do... Everything I do reminds me of her, and I feel extremely guilty for even feeling the slightest bit of happiness at any time. Idk if a therapist will work.... because I don't know if I want to feel happy after this...  I'm not suicidal... but I honestly don't know if I'll ever recover from this.

There's a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign! At this point I was beginning to somewhat calm down. I turned around and parked on the side of the road. I picked up litter for about 30-60 mins in the hot southern sun. Luckily I had a cheap duffel bag I wasn't using. Felt like I lost a pint of sweat (my fatass sweats a lot). After that I just got in my car and drove home. It's kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me.

324,1,"I spend all day on Reddit so I don't have to think about things that stress me out. The stupid thing is that there are things that I want to do, yet I always put them off until tomorrow. I've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. I have a tablet and can download Photoshop for free from my university, yet I haven't drawn a single panel. If I can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am I going to survive life?

I'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. Before winter break, I promised myself that I'd apply for the study abroad program that I need for graduation, but I haven't started that either. I'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since I haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. I know I need to just do it, but the more I put it off, the more anxious I get.

325,1,"I've suffered with depression all my life, I was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like I didn't fit in. My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

I've already lost so much and I don't know how I am going to cope when I'm here alone. I feel like I'll probably just see out my cats life and then take my own, nothing feels worth doing if I can't share it with her."
326,1,I’ve felt like this for quite some time and can’t quite shake it off.
327,1,"So there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. I'd always apologize even if I was wrong. I refused to apologize and it all fucked up. She knew I had depression when we were in relationship. I told her I feel depressed and she said ""There's no such thing as depression""

Anyway, she found out from out our common friend that I visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. So at the end of the chat,I told her I'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said ""I don't give a fuck even if you die""

I stopped texting her after that. I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.

EDIT: Just came home and saw your replies. I'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. In the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if I can help one person, I'd be the happiest person in this world."
328,1,"I just found out that my hairdresser is one of the people who bullied me a lot earlier in my life. I didn't recognise him, but he suddenly asked if I was DNAli3n, and we had a long talk while he did his job. He apologised for what he did and how he acted, and it removed a big load from my heart. Just wanted to share a ray of sunshine"

331,1,"I've spent 4 hours lying on the bed this afternoon. It's so hard to convince yourself because there's nothing to look forward to, nobody to talk to and you cannot find the reason for self-care. It's easier to stay in bed and struggle about things like self-hatred, sexuality, all the types of relationships and the future than to take steps to improve the situation. It's so hard when you have no emotional support, nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through things with you, step-by-step. 

Nobody's listening.

I'm aware that I cannot and should not rely on other for validation, and I cannot seek their help all the time. I'm aware that only I can change things. But as soon as I'm trying to be independent, everything just falls apart immediately. 

Why am I like this? I just want the demons to go away. I don't need to be happy, I just want this to stop."
332,1,"I feel like for as long as I have been depressed, I am  reliving the same day over and over again. Sometimes I just watch the clock change from 11:59 pm to 12:00 am and see the date change and think ""Yup, another day feeling the same way"". Time is moving forward and I am not. "
333,1,I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. I'm an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyone
334,1,Biggest fucking lie I've ever heard. 
335,1,"In July 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and I just wanted to say:

Have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! I know this year has sucked, and I'm here to let you know that it WILL work out, and if I care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in July, others do too. Stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and PLEASE don't end yourself because you DO matter! We love you! 
"
336,1,"It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. 

Have a heart. "
337,1,"Hey all, it's sort of been awhile since I've decided to do anything on Reddit. Just wanted to tell you a quick story and how it's left me.

5 months ago, I attempted suicide and fortunately I slowly started losing consciousness on my girlfriend's bed where she found me and promptly somehow resusciated me. We both cried, I told her she should've just let me. 
Two months later, my girlfriend had a break down and started packing her things and when I asked where she was going, she told me she was going up the mountains where we had first met, and where we wanted to eventually get married. I knew what she meant by that and I told her if she did some stupid shit like that I would go with her. She responded to me with, ""Okay, let's go then"". I became seriously afraid. I knew she was dead set and even me passing away with her wouldn't have stopped her. I called the non-emergency line and she fought for the phone. Nothing happened that night.

On the morning of April 11th, my girlfriend texted me around 4 am. She said she couldn't sleep. We started arguing over nonsense, and she told me that she was writing in her journal (like she usually does). I got mad because I thought she was writing something negative about me. About 2 hours later she calls me while she was driving over to my house to see me, she said that she only had written good things about me, and said she was going to come pick me up. She arrived at my house, she had no makeup and she had clearly been crying a lot, her 3 year old son was left at home asleep. 

We went to the bar, had a drink and smoked our cigarettes and vented/argued. We then left, and she dropped me off at my house. I was angry so I didn't give her a hug or kiss even though she grabbed me and tried to make me, I didn't even look at her. She called me about 5 minutes later and told me to look in my mailbox, inside the mailbox was my note for me, saying her goodbye. I wailed and my heart dropped down into my stomach. I hung up on her and called 911 and I knew exactly where she would go, those mountains, and I knew the exact spot in the mountains.
She sent me all of the money she had left in her bank account on Venmo. She made her last phone call to me, and just repeated ""Michael, talk to me. Please just talk to me. Talk to me"". I only yelled and screamed that the police were on their way and to please stop. She hung up on me.

That was the last I heard of her. My girlfriend died waiting for a helicopter to pick her up after she hung herself. When I got the news, I pounded my head on the concrete and punched the sidewalk. The police had to hold me down. 

Later that night, I stole my father's car and drove to the very same spot and tried hanging myself, the police got there and stopped me, I was sent to the hospital and stayed there for 7 days, grieving alone.

To this day, I wonder what I could've done better. If I had just talked to her, could I have talked her down? If I hugged or kissed her, would she have been okay? 

I'm not okay. I wish I had died that night. But I'm trying to recover, I'm trying to find purpose in waking up, in eating, in making friends. I find no interest in anything. The girl I was supposed to marry and have a child with is gone. 

The only thing that gives me happiness is knowing that her pain is gone. Her cervical cancer, her past of sexual abuse, the pain she felt from her mother taking her own life. 

Where do I go from here?"
338,1,"Now first off I feel it's imperative to say that I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact I haven't even talked to anyone about how awful I've been feeling the past year or so.  However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.  I just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible."
339,1,"After having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what I did today made me extremely happy. I hope I keep doing better.

Edit: thank you for all the support! I think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. I love this community."
340,1,"Is that depressed people are honestly some of the nicest, open-minded, loving people I have ever met/talked to. We all know how it feels to be in the darkest places, and we don't want to see anybody go through that. I feel like a lot of us would stand by somebody and help them through anything they needed. Whether it be big or small, depressed people know that there is no such thing as a big or small problem. Problems are problems. People just like to point and act like they know what we are going through. Like we are the mud on the bottom of the shoe, and can't ""Lighten up"". 

I really don't know any of you, but I already know that you are all some of the best people out there. I know how strong you all are, how loving you all are, how open-minded you all are. In some weird, seemingly contradictory way, you all are the love that is needed in the world. 

 Nobody wants to talk to a depressed person, but a depressed person would talk to anybody."
341,1,"Every week I buy a packet of strawberry bon bon's from the same shop because I did that every week when I was 12 and I associate the flavour and the smell with coming home from school, excited to spend the weekend playing video games.

I buy an energy drink every Wednesday because that was the night I used raid with my old WoW guild. Best times of my teenage years, and every Wednesday I had an energy drink alongside me. I'll probably do it tomorrow, too.

I stay up until 5AM regularly because I long to feel like I did when I was 14 and I remember staying up watching old movies I'd never seen before. I no longer get that sense of awe.

I used to eat pizza from the same place because I used to do it with my old band. The only place we ever went to and whenever I eat there I feel like I'm back in those days. 

Occasionally I walked the same route home that I did in High School so I can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl I fancied on MSN. That was a decade ago, though. MSN doesn't exist, she's moved on and I don't have anything to look forward to. 

The pizza place shut down recently, new management who can't make pizza worth shit. I fucking cried because I felt like that part of my life was finally gone. 

I wondered if, in 10 years, I'd be doing the same things but to re-live the memories I'm making now. I don't know if I will.

Depression has successfully taken away my ability to make new memories. Now my old ones are becoming harder to hold on to.

**Edit:** Hey everyone. I woke to an overwhelming response, thank you all for kind words, advice and for sharing your own tales of nostalgia. This is a hard subject for me, I look forward to the future but the past is special and I never want it to go away entirely. 

I'm not one for unique experiences, the memories I have were never holidays or the first time I kissed someone or when I left high-school, but rather a broad feeling because at some point there was a part of my life that was really good and even though doing it once was fun, doing it over and over and over again cemented it into my head as a source of overwhelming positivity. Hopefully by making broader improvements to my life they'll start to form again.

I'll continue to read the comments for as long as this post remains relevant. Thank you, if anyone else is trying to get one over on depression too, I'm right along with you."
342,1,"I realized that today. This little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. She even learned how to give ""human"" hugs. Everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. I never saw her do that to anyone or anything. Just me. 

Not always, but most of the times, when I'm stressed or I feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. Sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. Also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. Almost everynight. 

Today, I felt suicidal since the morning and I was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. It turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, I don't want to cause any harm to this little thing and that's what keeps me alive. "
343,1,"Hello everyone! About two years ago, on the anniversary of a near-suicide attempt, I posted an album here of different drawings I had made to cope over the year. The response was overwhelmingly positive and really encouraged me to continue pursuing my art. A lot of time has passed since then, and I’ve gotten a lot healthier as well as more skilled artistically, as it really helps me express myself in a positive way.

This project has taken me about 6 months to complete, and it’s been hard, but has really given me purpose and meaning. I cannot thank you all enough, for the role you have played in encouraging me to take this thing art thing more seriously. It has revolutionized my mental health.

So this project is something I've been working on for a while lately. It's called ""The Banality of Monsters,"" and it's ten ballpoint pen drawings, each with a corresponding text piece, telling a story about depression. Don't worry, I'm not selling this project or anything, I want it all to be free. I just want to draw. It gives me purpose. Thank you all so much for your support.

I don't feel like myself, I feel I've been declining since February, depression or stress? but never been like this.. this has come on over the past 7\-10 days.. it's a leap from rough days to feeling mad, I don't know what this is and my google searches are not helping..

346,1,"Hello everyone. As the title says, a year ago on June 20th I hit my lowest point. I had close calls before, but this one was worse. I was going to throw myself in front of a train. After that incident I decided to get my act together. I started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. In addition, I started to draw again. 

Some of the stuff in this album I have submitted to here or r/Anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. This is the first time I'm submitting almost everything I've done up til now, so I hope you guys like it and this helps you cope.

347,1,It seems only in my dreams does the feelings of hopelessness and unhappiness goes away.
348,1,I know I do :/ 
349,1,"You can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. But please, please don't ignore me. I want my existence to be acknowledged. I want to be sure that I'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing I'm there, like I'm an outsider looking in. Please don't make me feel any more isolated than I already do, like I have no friends who genuinely care about me. I know I suck, and I know I fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. I deserve it.

350,1,"Most days I feel like i'm in the middle of the ocean, gasping for air as I bob up and down trying to scream for help. Yet yards away are a beach, a beach of my friends and family. They know the signs, they know what ""drowning"" looks like, yet they do nothing. Just stare. Just stare as I try to keep my head above water. 

No matter how hard I scream, no matter how much I wave my arms hoping for someone to notice and help me out. No one moves.

Its just me. Alone. In the middle of the ocean. Praying I can just keep my head above water for at least a day."
351,1,"You might think this is a joke. It isn't. I've wanted to kill myself for a long while now, probably since around 12 years old. The only thing that alleviated my depression when I was younger was Fallout 3. It was the best game I'd ever played. I swore to myself when I got bored of FO3 (two years after it came out) that I wouldn't kill myself until Fallout 4 was released. I didn't count New Vegas, because, well, it sucked. Now that 4 is coming out, I don't know what to do with myself. I still want to die, but I can't just keep pushing it off until the next Fallout release. I'm addicted to the series, yes, but I'd like to have some motivation to live other than a video game. I feel so pathetic. I've attempted suicide twice before and been admitted to a ward for two weeks once, which only made things worse. What else is there to live for? People generally bore or upset me. I have a girlfriend, friends, family, pets, a job, everything I could really ask for. I'm not allowed to get medication as I'm still under my parents insurance. I'm working on going back to therapy, but my parent's think my depression is just in my head.  I'd really love some advice, or just someone to talk about random shit online with. 

I hope people don't see this as some kind of joke. Just writing this has helped, to some degree. 

Thanks.

Edit: Fallout was released last night at midnight. I'm feeling pretty good about it so far, but it better have some damn good replayability cuz fallout 5 is probably quite a ways off... I'm honestly surprised to see how much attention this got. Its really pretty cool that other people can empathize with me. Thanks all."

354,1,"Lately I have to keep my mind occupied on something, or else I feel like breaking down, like a damn that's about to burst. I keep fantasizing about a fictional version of me that isn't so broken. Someone who has made something of themselves. I've been watching hours of youtube and inserting my self into those videos and it's just making me more depressed. Someone who is normal and does normal people things. I feel like someone on the outside looking in. I still find it easier to just day dream than feel anything ""real"" in my actual life. Else I just feeling like killing my self. "
355,1,Sometimes I feel like people would appreciate my existence more if I were dead. Why is that?
356,1,"My attention span is shockingly short, I forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. 

The worst thing has to be the memory problems. I forget shit all the time. What chores I'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not I took my meds this morning. 

I also have a lot of trouble focusing. I can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. Even driving has proven dangerous a few times. Sometimes I doubt whether or not I should be out on the road. I can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.

People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see ""if you wanted to, you would"" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.

On top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things I *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things I have to get through before anything gets done. I have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. Then I have to remember what to do. Then I have to have the energy to do it. Then I have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.

I feel like I have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.

360,1,"I know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but I feel like depression changes my memory in a way that I never hear anyone else talk about. After a depressive episode, I feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and I have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. Even after I have fully recovered from the episode.

My last episode was during last fall, and even though I got better in the spring, I still feel like I have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. It just feels like everything is so different now, like I moved to a different town, but I didn't.

I don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. I am really curious if this happens to other people.

Edit: Wow. I did not expect so many replies. I know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after I'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. And I have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and I can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that I'm not just stupid or flakey. But hearing that this happens to so many other people too... I don't know. It sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like I am really not alone in this. I know there are other people out there who understand. Thank you for your comments :)"
361,1,"I feel like my brain has just rotted into swiss cheese. I used to have an incredible memory and now I can't remember what I did this morning (although doing nothing every day helps in this regard). I can't remember teachers names from high school or college without putting serious effort into it and even then I can't remember all of them. Seeing something about derivatives (math) and realizing that I took and passed calc 1 in college with a B but I literally can't remember what derivatives actually mean much less how to solve them is depressing in itself. It's like whatever work I managed to do 5-10 years ago is meaningless. It also makes the thought of going back to school impossible. 

I'd give anything to be average and to not constantly walk around forgetting what I'm doing or what I wanted to say. "

The other day, my supervisor and I talked about sending the office an email about how I'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return date


Fine. My apt. is a dumpster. I don't have real relationships. All I do is eat and throw up at 31. Never once have I uttered those words ""fine"", but others are saying it for me. I don't even know what I'm hoping for or want...but I feel like my illness is all made up in my head. If I had cancer, nobody would say I was fine. I get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is ""less"" than a physical illness.  


I'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. I'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. I'm not fine. I don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but I have to. Because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. 


Back when I asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something ""serious"" so that people wouldn't worry."

367,1,"I go to one of the largest universities in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life. Yesterday, I was killing time in between classes as usual, sitting near some trees in a popular part of campus to study at. On a scale from 0-10, my depression was at an 8 or 9 and I desperately needed help. I posted on Yik Yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug (Yik Yak is a popular app among college students kind of like an anonymous twitter, and you can only see posts within a mile away from you or something like that). I ended up deleting the post almost instantly because I felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug. But within a minute, a random girl peeked at my phone, asked if I was the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while I choked back tears. I still can't believe it happened. I didn't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day. "

369,1,"The people I work with are quite bubbly, talkative, and sociable, but there are a lot of times I just don't have it in me to try to socialize. My job locks me in a room with 1-2 other people for 12 hours+, so talking and playing games is the only way to pass the time. When I'm not actively talking or contributing to the conversation and they ask me what's wrong, my response is always ""sorry, I'm just tired,"" when I mean ""sorry, I feel like a useless piece of shit today, you'll have to excuse me."" Do I want to socialize with my co-workers? Of course. Does my mood/brain want me to socialize? Hell no, it wants me to brood in the corner and overthink. 

I even do this in my personal relationships. When I'm in a bad mood (which is about 99% of the time anymore) and I shuffle around the house not really talking to anyone, and my mom or step-dad ask if I'm okay, my response is always ""I'm just tired,"" then I'll go to my room, shut my door, and only come out for basic necessities for the rest of the day. I haven't talked to my friends in God knows how long because I'm just not mentally prepared to most days. I'm scared I'll lose them eventually. My phone is never moved from where its set down when I came home from work because no one is concerned enough to talk to me unless they need something. "
370,1,"I spend probably 90% of my days daydreaming. Sitting in class, watching TV, playing video games etc I'm always daydreaming

I go to this fantasy world where I actually have a passion and I actually have support and friends where I'm the best at something. Some cultural icon.

It's unhealthy and it's caused me to stop myself from ever being happy in life. How could I ever be happy when all I think about is what if I was someone else? Some amazing artist? Musician? And not just this talentless loser who will spend the majority of his life grinding a 9-5 and the most exciting thing I do is play video games on the weekends?

And then I get the whole bullshit about ""well instead of daydreaming about it, go start finding your passion and get good at it""

I'm hoping you guys know that that is just bullshit. It hurts me every time. I'm tired of hearing it.

Learning how to accept being a nobody sucks. Idk if I will ever fully accept it."
371,1,"If I had the opportunity to talk about my problems, I couldn't really say anything. So many things come to mind, but nothing seems like a good reason to be depressed. It would all just sound pathetic if I said it out loud. But still, I feel like shit, and all these stupid little things are making it even worse.

But I don't feel bad all the time. In fact, I'm probably just fine more than half of the time. And that's why depression always hits hard. It always comes when I start thinking that I'll be okay for a while. And then I have to choose between getting comfortable with it or fighting against it. Next time I start having fun I ask myself whether or not there's a point in doing so."
372,1,"Sometimes I think about my current situation I'm in and I think: "" I have no reason to be depressed"" and sometimes I see others with depression who have a good reason to be depressed but sometimes I feel ashamed to think I have depression when I think of other people's misfortune despite my own misfortune.

I even avoid saying I'm depressed and just say I'm sad now because I feel like I'm insulting those who are depressed."
373,1,There's just nothing interesting.
374,1,"When I was 16 it was so strange to me. I have a journal entry where I wrote, ""This isn't who I'm supposed to be."" Everybody noticed me go from goofy A-student to constantly skipping classes and looking so empty and sad.

I tried to fight it. I really did. But fast-forward 11 years and the 16-year-old me is gone. The intelligence is there, just not applied towards anything useful or productive. The humor is there sometimes, just more morbid and mostly kept to myself. 

I am constantly fatigued, unfocused, sad, irritable, pessimistic, and anxious. The most common coping mechanisms I have that give me comfort are food and TV/games. ""Oh but I'm NOT really like this—it's my depression!"" That's what I said for a fucking decade and I can't even believe it anymore.

My depression is who I am now most of the time, and it's been that way for years. It's become my personality. It's become so normal I don't remember that people aren't supposed to feel and act like this. It's not fucking normal to take a few hours to get out of bed, not shower for days, and do nothing but binge eat, watch TV, play games, and sleep for days and even weeks on end. I can't stand it anymore.

I just took a Wellbutrin again after giving up on it after a week last time. Fuck it, can't get any worse. I have to tell myself that I have a serious problem and the only way is to get help. Because if I don't then I'm back in that damn pit again, feeling miserable yet powerless to ever change it.

377,1,"i just feel really excited and  happy right now. i woke up at 9:19, (I have been waking up at 3pm and staying in bed all day, too depressed) but today i woke up so early and i'm about to leave to go get starbucks! wow, maybe ""new year, new me"" can be true this year.... :) i hope everyone has a wonderful day"

380,1,"Reddit,

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

All of my previous posts here have been eaten by the auto mod I think, but thank you to anyone who reads my story.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for everyone's support. 

Here's a little something about my first day:

These new co-workers, I already can tell they talk bad about others but basically to warn me about a chatty Cathy, and from two individually they mentioned that the IT guys walking around (doing yearly maintenance it looked like) were nerds through and through...but I can't help but chuckle at that. The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now. 

I assisted during one procedure today. And it went well. My preceptor has twenty years of experience in GI and I can tell she's not aware of some best practices, but she's a wonderful lady with 4 grandkids and high energy. I can appreciate that she knows what she's doing. And has the answers to my simple questions. I'll actually be working at 3 different locations for this hospital system, but I'll get comfortable with hospital #1 before I move to #2 then #3.

I also was given a few checklists to complete. One was computer education, which I completed entirely. Long story short, I had a great first day!!"
381,1,I talked to a girl and actually got her number. As someone with sever anxiety and depression I finally did it. She even called me cute and complimented me on my hair. For the first time in a long time I feel something.
382,1,that includes random online people.  not fishing for attention. 
383,1,"he's 5 years older than me, i remember it was like summer of 2013 and i just started dodging social events, i remember one day binging season 6 of how i met your mother while all of my friends(back when i had any) were outside playing football and messing around the entire day,

i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, 

he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of ""talks"" on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this: 

*you can't possibly understand now, but you will see it in couple of years if you become like me, how stupid you'll feel waking up one day to realize how everyone around you has left, moved on and you are still in the same spot you were years ago... if you sit in your room and jerk off on computer all day long nothing will happen to you, ever, but it takes you years to truly realize that*

i always found it funny how he's giving me advices and shit but he is fucked up himself, it's ironic how i'm exactly like him right now, soon to be 23, unemployed for 8 months, exhausted from social anxiety and depression, i spend most of the time inside on pc, watching my friends on social media being happy and having such normal lives, big majority of ppl i know has left for jobs or college"
384,1,"I don't know about you guys, but I constantly feel like I'm just a lazy piece of shit, and not somebody with depression.

Doesn't matter how many suicidal thoughts I have... Nah, just a lazy shitbag who doesn't give a fuck about their degree and spends hours a day on League of Legends. 

That's me. It's great. Especially when it's backed up by your parents complaining that you don't actually study. "

I'll snuggle up with my teddy bears as best as I can and try and sleep.... though what's the point if it makes tomorrow arrive sooner? Tomorrow... another day of feeling like this. Another day of feeling like this. Then another and another.

388,1,"Ever feel like everyone is getting better in life and your kinda just staying the same? As in everyone is getting new friends, new relationships, new opportunities ect. Pretty much everyone is getting ahead and your getting left behind?"
389,1,Guys I know this might be stupid.  But I finally was able to make my bed. Like I mean having sheets on it and stuff. I know otherwise it's gross. This is really big for me. I final didn't feel like it was useless to do. Sorry. I'm gross. But I'm actually proud. (Wish it didn't happen at 3:30 am because I can't sleep but oh well I got a burst of energy so I did it.) I'm feeling tired now but I hope this boost will stay tomorrow to clean other things.  Sorry if this sounds stupid.

391,1,"* You sleep 4 hours some nights and 16 hours others. 
* The grocery store is right across the street but you just can't get over there to buy food.

* You run out of clothes to wear because you just can't make yourself do the laundry. 
* Dirty dishes pile up in the sink even when you do manage to run the dishwasher, because ypu can't manage to unload it. 
* You come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything. 
* If you're unemployed like me, same, but as soon as you wake up. 
* Sometimes you do make it out of bed, and onto the floor. The door is just too far away.

* You regularly go days without leaving your apartment. 
* You get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted. 
* You think of things you normally like to do, and just don't care to actually do them. When you do, you just get bored and don't get any enjoyment from it. 
* You hear the phone ring and just can't be bothered to get up and answer it. 
* You try as hard as you can to think positively, but everything just feels dull and grey. 
* When you do ""well"" you just feel apathetic and that you only did what was expected of you. 
* Your goal in life is to minimize suffering instead of maximizing enjoyment.

* You can't remember a time in life where you truly felt happy. Moments of pleasure are scarce and fleeting. 
* You don't take vacation days because there's nowhere you want to go. 
* You hate being around happy people because it just reminds you of how bad you feel. 
* You take antidepressants and see a therapist and it doesn't really help. "
392,1,I don't know why I do this. I don't like appearing vulnerable I guess? Or maybe because my mind's so messed up they wouldn't be able to help me anyway and it's daunting to explain everything.
393,1,
394,1,"I'm posting this here because I don't really know where else to put it. I noticed the sidebar link to SuicideWatch, but it didn't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help. 

Since I was a teenager I've had ""casual"" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go ""I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier"" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think ""you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head."" I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like ""yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!""

This has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently I've been thinking about how fucked up it is. And I feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode. 

I just had to get this off my chest. It's difficult to have these cavalier thoughts and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/""imposter syndrome"" to seem normal every day. "

396,1,"For no particular reason. 

Just as a baby step, going outside, enjoying myself **for myself**. I've forgotten how to do this. Let's re-try for hundredth time."
397,1,"Ok, done. They said the same old platitudes that everyone has heard a million times. ""It gets better"" ""take it day by day"" ""lots of people care about you"" etc. 

So now that they know an embarrassing and vulnerable fact about me, what have I gained? Do I feel better? Are they going to have any insight or advice that I haven't already learned? Ha, no. At best they have sympathy for me (which I don't want), and at worst they will be uncomfortable and not want to interact with me anymore (this happened with 3 different friends before I finally learned my lesson).

I mean, perhaps that helps for people with very mild or temporary depression. And that's fine and all, but it's pretty discouraging when the advice literally begins and ends with ""talk to someone."" If you say ""yeah so I tried that..."" they'll just throw their hands up and tell you to use drugs. 

Or just say ""hang in there!"" Hang in there, huh? Just a few more decades and you'll die naturally :) Hang in there, every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain, but do it anyway :) Depression causes you to be a worthless failure because you don't have the motivation to further your career or social life, but hang in there as a complete loser!

Then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone' is a 'therapist.' ""Talk to a therapist and get help."" Ok, let me just pull money out of my ass, and pay hundreds of dollars for someone who probably won't be able to do shit for me anyway. But that's another story..."
398,1,"She texted me to say good bye while I was gone for a couple hours today. I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.

12/03/2012: I am doing much better everyone. I thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. Life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part. The only lingering effects is the last image of her, every time something remind me of her my mind goes straight to that. That happens quite a bit, but hopefully that will pass as the other pain has. To those that have messaged me saying how much this has helped them, it really means a lot to me. I am glad some good could have come from this at least. If anyone needs to talk, please feel free to message me."
