i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore"", no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

i had a decent life back in high school, it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral, i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard"

i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, 

he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of ""talks"" on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this: 

*you can't possibly understand now, but you will see it in couple of years if you become like me, how stupid you'll feel waking up one day to realize how everyone around you has left, moved on and you are still in the same spot you were years ago... if you sit in your room and jerk off on computer all day long nothing will happen to you, ever, but it takes you years to truly realize that*

2674,0,0.0865,0.172,0.621,0.207,"I asked him (in a pub casually so that he felt relaxed and not pressured) why he wanted this drug; opiates, while providing pain relief, can be very addictive and dangerous."
2675,0,-0.5267,0.246,0.645,0.109,He basically told me that his pain and trauma are bigger than anything pot and cigarettes could help with.
2676,0,0.701,0.085,0.698,0.216,I told him its a very bad idea to buy opiates off the street and if he is looking for help all he needs to do is ask and we will try to help best we can.

2678,0,0.8176,0.043,0.645,0.312,He agreed not to go through with the transaction so I told him I was proud of him and I swear he smiled a little bit.
2679,0,-0.2247,0.136,0.864,0.0,"As you may of remembered, Jonathan since meeting him has been extremely aggressive."
2680,0,0.2263,0.0,0.905,0.095,I was prepared to take this on since the moment I met him as I am much taller and bigger than him.

2682,0,0.8863,0.052,0.748,0.199,"Well, Jonathan has thrown things at me and attempted to hit me and such many, many times since I met him but he has never tried to hurt my wife at all and for that I see he is a good boy and he can live a normal, happy life eventually if he can get passed all the trauma in his life."
2683,0,0.0534,0.07,0.852,0.078,"Well I signed him up for boxing early on and gave him a punching bag and that helped at the beginning, although he was still very aggressive."

2689,0,0.4215,0.0,0.843,0.157,I think one of the things with Jonathan is he likes to be treated as an equal.
2690,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Jonathan speaks more than he used to.
2691,0,0.1027,0.07,0.847,0.083,This is a great achievement because in my orignal post he just got angry or was silent but in these past two months he has started to speak more.
2692,0,0.3612,0.0,0.828,0.172,Sometimes just random things like 'have you read this article in the newspaper'.
2693,0,0.8954,0.0,0.605,0.395,It's a slow process but it's really awesome seeing Jonathan progress further and further as time goes on.

5125,0,0.2263,0.0,0.905,0.095,I prepared myself mentally to pop the question to her when we get to somewhere chill (like a café or something).
5126,0,-0.0618,0.15,0.742,0.108,Problem was though that I never got the chance to talk to her in private because we had another friend who always hung out with us.
5127,0,-0.4526,0.198,0.802,0.0,So I didn't feel comfortable to seperate him from us for a minute or two.
5128,0,-0.6294,0.318,0.682,0.0,I tried to but just ended up making things a tiny bit awkward so I stopped.

6718,0,-0.4939,0.144,0.856,0.0,** It was scary because I had to board a small van for about an hour before taking a cab to get home.
6719,0,-0.6617,0.174,0.826,0.0,I didn't dare to look in the box while in the van because it was really crowded and things could've gone VERY wrong!
